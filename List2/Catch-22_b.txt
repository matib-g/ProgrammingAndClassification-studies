Joseph Heller Catch-22 The island Pianosa lies Mediterranean Sea eight miles south Elba . It small obviously could accommodate actions described . Like setting novel , characters , , fictitious . TO MY MOTHER AND TO SHIRLEY , AND MY CHILDREN , ERICA AND TED 1 THE TEXAN It love first sight . The first time Yossarian saw chaplain fell madly love . Yossarian hospital pain liver fell short jaundice . The doctors puzzled fact ’ quite jaundice . If became jaundice could treat . If ’ become jaundice went away could discharge . But short jaundice time confused . Each morning came around , three brisk serious men efficient mouths inefficient eyes , accompanied brisk serious Nurse Duckett , one ward nurses ’ like Yossarian . They read chart foot bed asked impatiently pain . They seemed irritated told exactly . “ Still movement ? ” full colonel demanded . The doctors exchanged look shook head . “ Give another pill. ” Nurse Duckett made note give Yossarian another pill , four moved along next bed . None nurses liked Yossarian . Actually , pain liver gone away , Yossarian ’ say anything doctors never suspected . They suspected moving bowels telling anyone . Yossarian everything wanted hospital . The food ’ bad , meals brought bed . There extra rations fresh meat , hot part afternoon others served chilled fruit juice chilled chocolate milk . Apart doctors nurses , one ever disturbed . For little morning censor letters , free spend rest day lying around idly clear conscience . He comfortable hospital , easy stay always ran temperature 101 . He even comfortable Dunbar , keep falling face order get meals brought bed . After made mind spend rest war hospital , Yossarian wrote letters everyone knew saying hospital never mentioning . One day better idea . To everyone knew wrote going dangerous mission . “ They asked volunteers . It ’ dangerous , someone . I ’ write instant I get back. ” And written anyone since . All officer patients ward forced censor letters written enlisted-men patients , kept residence wards . It monotonous job , Yossarian disappointed learn lives enlisted men slightly interesting lives officers . After first day curiosity . To break monotony invented games . Death modifiers , declared one day , every letter passed hands went every adverb every adjective . The next day made war articles . He reached much higher plane creativity following day blacked everything letters , . That erected dynamic intralinear tensions , felt , every case left message far universal . Soon proscribing parts salutations signatures leaving text untouched . One time blacked salutation “ Dear Mary ” letter , bottom wrote , “ I yearn tragically . R. O. Shipman , Chaplain , U.S. Army. ” R. O. Shipman group chaplain ’ name . When exhausted possibilities letters , began attacking names addresses envelopes , obliterating whole homes streets , annihilating entire metropolises careless flicks wrist though God . Catch-22 required censored letter bear censoring officer ’ name . Most letters ’ read . On ’ read wrote name . On read wrote , “ Washington Irving. ” When grew monotonous wrote , “ Irving Washington. ” Censoring envelopes serious repercussions , produced ripple anxiety ethereal military echelon floated C.I.D . man back ward posing patient . They knew C.I.D . man kept inquiring officer named Irving Washington first day ’ censor letters . He found monotonous . It good ward time , one best Dunbar ever enjoyed . With time twenty-four-year-old fighter-pilot captain sparse golden mustache shot Adriatic Sea midwinter even caught cold . Now summer upon , captain shot , said grippe . In bed Yossarian ’ right , still lying amorously belly , startled captain malaria blood mosquito bite ass . Across aisle Yossarian Dunbar , next Dunbar artillery captain Yossarian stopped playing chess . The captain good chess player , games always interesting . Yossarian stopped playing chess games interesting foolish . Then educated Texan Texas looked like someone Technicolor felt , patriotically , people means-decent folk-should given votes drifters , whores , criminals , degenerates , atheists indecent folk-people without means . Yossarian unspringing rhythms letters day brought Texan . It another quiet , hot , untroubled day . The heat pressed heavily roof , stifling sound . Dunbar lying motionless back eyes staring ceiling like doll ’ . He working hard increasing life span . He cultivating boredom . Dunbar working hard increasing life span Yossarian thought dead . They put Texan bed middle ward , ’ long donated views . Dunbar sat like shot . “ That ’ , ” cried excitedly . “ There something missing-all time I knew something missing-and I know is. ” He banged fist palm . “ No patriotism , ” declared . “ You ’ right , ” Yossarian shouted back . “ You ’ right , ’ right , ’ right . The hot dog , Brooklyn Dodgers . Mom ’ apple pie . That ’ everyone ’ fighting . But ’ fighting decent folk ? Who ’ fighting votes decent folk ? There ’ patriotism , ’ . And matriotism , either. ” The warrant officer Yossarian ’ left unimpressed . “ Who gives shit ? ” asked tiredly , turned side go sleep . The Texan turned good-natured , generous likable . In three days one could stand . He sent shudders annoyance scampering ticklish spines , everybody fled him-everybody soldier white , choice . The soldier white encased head toe plaster gauze . He two useless legs two useless arms . He smuggled ward night , men idea among awoke morning saw two strange legs hoisted hips , two strange arms anchored perpendicularly , four limbs pinioned strangely air lead weights suspended darkly never moved . Sewn bandages insides elbows zippered lips fed clear fluid clear jar . A silent zinc pipe rose cement groin coupled slim rubber hose carried waste kidneys dripped efficiently clear , stoppered jar floor . When jar floor full , jar feeding elbow empty , two simply switched quickly stuff could drip back . All ever really saw soldier white frayed black hole mouth . The soldier white filed next Texan , Texan sat sideways bed talked throughout morning , afternoon evening pleasant , sympathetic drawl . The Texan never minded got reply . Temperatures taken twice day ward . Early morning late afternoon Nurse Cramer entered jar full thermometers worked way one side ward , distributing thermometer patient . She managed soldier white inserting thermometer hole mouth leaving balanced lower rim . When returned man first bed , took thermometer recorded temperature , moved next bed continued around ward . One afternoon completed first circuit ward came second time soldier white , read thermometer discovered dead . “ Murderer , ” Dunbar said quietly . The Texan looked uncertain grin . “ Killer , ” Yossarian said . What fellas talkin ” ? ” Texan asked nervously . “ You murdered , ” said Dunbar . “ You killed , ” said Yossarian . The Texan shrank back . “ You fellas crazy . I ’ even touch him. ” “ You murdered , ” said Dunbar . “ I heard kill , ” said Yossarian . “ You killed nigger , ” Dunbar said . “ You fellas crazy , ” Texan cried . “ They ’ allow niggers . They got special place niggers. ” “ The sergeant smuggled , ” Dunbar said . “ The Communist sergeant , ” said Yossarian . “ And knew it. ” The warrant officer Yossarian ’ left unimpressed entire incident soldier white . The warrant officer unimpressed everything never spoke unless show irritation . The day Yossarian met chaplain , stove exploded mess hall set fire one side kitchen . An intense heat flashed area . Even Yossarian ’ ward , almost three hundred feet away , could hear roar blaze sharp cracks flaming timber . Smoke sped past orange-tinted windows . In fifteen minutes crash trucks airfield arrived fight fire . For frantic half hour touch go . Then firemen began get upper hand . Suddenly monotonous old drone bombers returning mission , firemen roll hoses speed back field case one planes crashed caught fire . The planes landed safely . As soon last one , firemen wheeled trucks around raced back hill resume fight fire hospital . When got , blaze . It died accord , expired completely without even ember watered , nothing disappointed firemen drink tepid coffee hang around trying screw nurses . The chaplain arrived day fire . Yossarian busy expurgating romance words letters chaplain sat chair beds asked feeling . He placed bit one side , captain ’ bars tab shirt collar insignia Yossarian could see . Yossarian idea took granted either another doctor another madman . “ Oh , pretty good , ” answered . “ I ’ got slight pain liver I ’ regular fellows , I guess , I must admit I feel pretty good. ” “ That ’ good , ” said chaplain . “ Yes , ” Yossarian said . “ Yes , good. ” “ I meant come around sooner , ” chaplain said , “ I really ’ well. ” “ That ’ bad , ” Yossarian said . “ Just head cold , ” chaplain added quickly . “ I ’ got fever hundred one , ” Yossarian added quickly . “ That ’ bad , ” said chaplain . “ Yes , ” Yossarian agreed . “ Yes , bad. ” The chaplain fidgeted . “ Is anything I ? ” asked . “ No , no. ” Yossarian sighed . “ The doctors ’ humanly possible , I suppose. ” “ No , no. ” The chaplain colored faintly . “ I ’ mean anything like . I meant cigarettes… books… or… toys. ” “ No , , ” Yossarian said . “ Thank . I everything I need , I suppose-everything good health. ” “ That ’ bad. ” “ Yes , ” Yossarian said . “ Yes , bad. ” The chaplain stirred . He looked side side times , gazed ceiling , floor . He drew deep breath . “ Lieutenant Nately sends regards , ” said . Yossarian sorry hear mutual friend . It seemed basis conversation . “ You know Lieutenant Nately ? ” asked regretfully . “ Yes , I know Lieutenant Nately quite well. ” “ He ’ bit loony , ’ ? ” The chaplain ’ smile embarrassed . “ I ’ afraid I ’ say . I ’ think I know well. ” “ You take word , ” Yossarian said . “ He ’ goofy come. ” The chaplain weighed next silence heavily shattered abrupt question . “ You Captain Yossarian , ’ ? ” “ Nately bad start . He came good family. ” “ Please excuse , ” chaplain persisted timorously . “ I may committing grave error . Are Captain Yossarian ? ” “ Yes , ” Captain Yossarian confessed . “ I Captain Yossarian. ” “ Of 256th Squadron ? ” “ Of fighting 256th Squadron , ” Yossarian replied . “ I ’ know Captain Yossarians . As far I know , I ’ Captain Yossarian I know , ’ far I know. ” “ I see , ” chaplain said unhappily . “ That ’ two fighting eighth power , ” Yossarian pointed , “ ’ thinking writing symbolic poem squadron. ” “ No , ” mumbled chaplain . “ I ’ thinking writing symbolic poem squadron. ” Yossarian straightened sharply spied tiny silver cross side chaplain ’ collar . He thoroughly astonished , never really talked chaplain . “ You ’ chaplain , ” exclaimed ecstatically . “ I ’ know chaplain. ” “ Why , yes , ” chaplain answered . “ Didn ’ know I chaplain ? ” “ Why , . I ’ know chaplain. ” Yossarian stared big , fascinated grin . “ I ’ never really seen chaplain before. ” The chaplain flushed gazed hands . He slight man thirty-two tan hair brown diffident eyes . His face narrow rather pale . An innocent nest ancient pimple pricks lay basin cheek . Yossarian wanted help . “ Can I anything help ? ” chaplain asked . Yossarian shook head , still grinning . “ No , I ’ sorry . I everything I need I ’ quite comfortable . In fact , I ’ even sick. ” “ That ’ good. ” As soon chaplain said words , sorry shoved knuckles mouth giggle alarm , Yossarian remained silent disappointed . “ There men group I must visit , ” apologized finally . “ I ’ come see , probably tomorrow. ” “ Please , ” Yossarian said . “ I ’ come want , ” chaplain said , lowering head shyly . “ I ’ noticed I make many men uncomfortable. ” Yossarian glowed affection . “ I want , ” said . “ You ’ make uncomfortable. ” The chaplain beamed gratefully peered slip paper concealing hand . He counted along beds ward , moving lips , centered attention dubiously Dunbar . “ May I inquire , ” whispered softly , “ Lieutenant Dunbar ? ” “ Yes , ” Yossarian answered loudly , “ Lieutenant Dunbar. ” “ Thank , ” chaplain whispered . “ Thank much . I must visit . I must visit every member group hospital. ” “ Even wards ? ” Yossarian asked . “ Even wards. ” “ Be careful wards , Father , ” Yossarian warned . “ That ’ keep mental cases . They ’ filled lunatics. ” “ It ’ necessary call Father , ” chaplain explained . “ I ’ Anabaptist. ” “ I ’ dead serious wards , ” Yossarian continued grimly . “ M.P.s ’ protect , ’ craziest . I ’ go , I ’ scared stiff : Insanity contagious . This sane ward whole hospital . Everybody crazy us . This probably sane ward whole world , matter. ” The chaplain rose quickly edged away Yossarian ’ bed , nodded conciliating smile promised conduct appropriate caution . “ And I must visit Lieutenant Dunbar , ” said . Still lingered , remorsefully . “ How Lieutenant Dunbar ? ” asked last . “ As good go , ” Yossarian assured . “ A true prince . One finest , least dedicated men whole world. ” “ I ’ mean , ” chaplain answered , whispering . “ Is sick ? ” “ No , ’ sick . In fact , ’ sick all. ” “ That ’ good. ” The chaplain sighed relief . “ Yes , ” Yossarian said . “ Yes , good. ” “ A chaplain , ” Dunbar said chaplain visited gone . “ Did see ? A chaplain. ” “ Wasn ’ sweet ? ” said Yossarian . “ Maybe give three votes. ” “ Who ’ ? ” Dunbar demanded suspiciously . In bed small private section end ward , always working ceaselessly behind green plyboard partition , solemn middle-aged colonel visited every day gentle , sweet-faced woman curly ash-blond hair nurse Wac Red Cross girl nevertheless appeared faithfully hospital Pianosa afternoon wearing pretty pastel summer dresses smart white leather pumps heels half high base nylon seams inevitably straight . The colonel Communications , kept busy day night transmitting glutinous messages interior square pads gauze sealed meticulously delivered covered white pail stood night table beside bed . The colonel gorgeous . He cavernous mouth , cavernous cheeks , cavernous , sad , mildewed eyes . His face color clouded silver . He coughed quietly , gingerly , dabbed pads slowly lips distaste become automatic . The colonel dwelt vortex specialists still specializing trying determine troubling . They hurled lights eyes see could see , rammed needles nerves hear could feel .

When rose walk , bent forward even , making deep cavity body , placed feet carefully , moving ahead inches knees . There violet pools eyes . The woman spoke softly , softer colonel coughed , none men ward ever heard voice . In less ten days Texan cleared ward . The artillery captain broke first , exodus started . Dunbar , Yossarian fighter captain bolted morning . Dunbar stopped dizzy spells , fighter captain blew nose . Yossarian told doctors pain liver gone away . It easy . Even warrant officer fled . In less ten days , Texan drove everybody ward back duty-everybody C.I.D . man , caught cold fighter captain come pneumonia . 2 CLEVINGER In way C.I.D . man pretty lucky , outside hospital war still going . Men went mad rewarded medals . All world , boys every side bomb line laying lives told country , one seemed mind , least boys laying young lives . There end sight . The end sight Yossarian ’ , might remained hospital doomsday patriotic Texan infundibuliform jowls lumpy , rumpleheaded , indestructible smile cracked forever across front face like brim black ten-gallon hat . The Texan wanted everybody ward happy Yossarian Dunbar . He really sick . But Yossarian ’ happy , even though Texan ’ want , outside hospital still nothing funny going . The thing going war , one seemed notice Yossarian Dunbar . And Yossarian tried remind people , drew away thought crazy . Even Clevinger , known better ’ , told crazy last time seen , Yossarian fled hospital . Clevinger stared apoplectic rage indignation , clawing table hands , shouted , “ You ’ crazy ! ” “ Clevinger , want people ? ” Dunbar replied wearily noises officers ’ club . “ I ’ joking , ” Clevinger persisted . “ They ’ trying kill , ” Yossarian told calmly . “ No one ’ trying kill , ” Clevinger cried . “ Then shooting ? ” Yossarian asked . “ They ’ shooting everyone , ” Clevinger answered . “ They ’ trying kill everyone. ” “ And difference make ? ” Clevinger already way , half chair emotion , eyes moist lips quivering pale . As always occurred quarreled principles believed passionately , would end gasping furiously air blinking back bitter tears conviction . There many principles Clevinger believed passionately . He crazy . “ Who ’ ? ” wanted know . “ Who , specifically , think trying murder ? ” “ Every one , ” Yossarian told . “ Every one ? ” “ Every one think ? ” “ I ’ idea. ” “ Then know ’ ? ” “ Because… ” Clevinger sputtered , turned speechless frustration . Clevinger really thought right , Yossarian proof , strangers ’ know shot cannons every time flew air drop bombs , ’ funny . And ’ funny , lots things ’ even funnier . There nothing funny living like bum tent Pianosa fat mountains behind placid blue sea front could gulp person cramp twinkling eye ship back shore three days later , charges paid , bloated , blue putrescent , water draining cold nostrils . The tent lived stood right smack wall shallow , dull-colored forest separating squadron Dunbar ’ . Immediately alongside abandoned railroad ditch carried pipe carried aviation gasoline fuel trucks airfield . Thanks Orr , roommate , luxurious tent squadron . Each time Yossarian returned one holidays hospital rest leaves Rome , surprised new comfort Orr installed absence-running water , wood-burning fireplace , cement floor . Yossarian chosen site , Orr raised tent together . Orr , grinning pygmy pilot ’ wings thick , wavy brown hair parted middle , furnished knowledge , Yossarian , taller , stronger , broader faster , work . Just two lived , although tent big enough six . When summer came , Orr rolled side flaps allow breeze never blew flush away air baking inside . Immediately next door Yossarian Havermeyer , liked peanut brittle lived two-man tent shot tiny field mice every night huge bullets the.45 stolen dead man Yossarian ’ tent . On side Havermeyer stood tent McWatt longer shared Clevinger , still returned Yossarian came hospital . McWatt shared tent Nately , away Rome courting sleepy whore fallen deeply love bored work bored . McWatt crazy . He pilot flew plane low dared Yossarian ’ tent often could , see much could frighten , loved go buzzing wild , close roar wooden raft floating empty oil drums past sand bar immaculate white beach men went swimming naked . Sharing tent man crazy ’ easy , Nately ’ care . He crazy , , gone every free day work officers ’ club Yossarian helped build . Actually , many officers ’ clubs Yossarian helped build , proudest one Pianosa . It sturdy complex monument powers determination . Yossarian never went help finished ; went often , pleased large , fine , rambling , shingled building . It truly splendid structure , Yossarian throbbed mighty sense accomplishment time gazed reflected none work gone . There four seated together table officers ’ club last time Clevinger called crazy . They seated back near crap table Appleby always managed win . Appleby good shooting crap playing ping-pong , good playing ping-pong everything else . Everything Appleby , well . Appleby fair-haired boy Iowa believed God , Motherhood American Way Life , without ever thinking , everybody knew liked . “ I hate son bitch , ” Yossarian growled . The argument Clevinger begun minutes earlier Yossarian unable find machine gun . It busy night . The bar busy , crap table busy , ping-gong table busy . The people Yossarian wanted machine-gun busy bar singing sentimental old favorites nobody else ever tired . Instead machine-gunning , brought heel hard ping-pong ball came rolling toward paddle one two officers playing . “ That Yossarian , ” two officers laughed , shaking heads , got another ball box shelf . “ That Yossarian , ” Yossarian answered . “ Yossarian , ” Nately whispered cautioningly . “ You see I mean ? ” asked Clevinger . The officers laughed heard Yossarian mimicking . “ That Yossarian , ” said loudly . “ That Yossarian , ” Yossarian echoed . “ Yossarian , please , ” Nately pleaded . “ You see I mean ? ” asked Clevinger . “ He antisocial aggressions. ” “ Oh , shut , ” Dunbar told Clevinger . Dunbar liked Clevinger Clevinger annoyed made time go slow . “ Appleby ’ even , ” Clevinger pointed triumphantly Yossarian . “ Who said anything Appleby ? ” Yossarian wanted know . “ Colonel Cathcart ’ , either. ” “ Who said anything Colonel Cathcart ? ” “ What son bitch hate , ? ” “ What son bitch ? ” “ I ’ going argue , ” Clevinger decided . “ You ’ know hate. ” “ Whoever ’ trying poison , ” Yossarian told . “ Nobody ’ trying poison you. ” “ They poisoned food twice , ’ ? Didn ’ put poison food Ferrara Great Big Siege Bologna ? ” “ They put poison everybody ’ food , ” Clevinger explained . “ And difference make ? ” “ And ’ even poison ! ” Clevinger cried heatedly , growing emphatic grew confused . As far back Yossarian could recall , explained Clevinger patient smile , somebody always hatching plot kill . There people cared people ’ , ’ hated get . They hated Assyrian . But ’ touch , told Clevinger , sound mind pure body strong ox . They ’ touch Tarzan , Mandrake , Flash Gordon . He Bill Shakespeare . He Cain , Ulysses , Flying Dutchman ; Lot Sodom , Deirdre Sorrows , Sweeney nightingales among trees . He miracle ingredient Z-247 . He was- “ Crazy ! ” Clevinger interrupted , shrieking . “ That ’ ! Crazy ! ” “ -immense . I ’ real , slam-bang , honest-to-goodness , three-fisted humdinger . I ’ bona fide supraman. ” “ Superman ? ” Clevinger cried . “ Superman ? ” “ Supraman , ” Yossarian corrected . “ Hey , fellas , cut , ” Nately begged embarrassment . “ Everybody ’ looking us. ” “ You ’ crazy , ” Clevinger shouted vehemently , eyes filling tears . “ You ’ got Jehovah complex. ” “ I think everyone Nathaniel. ” Clevinger arrested mid-declamation , suspiciously . “ Who ’ Nathaniel ? ” “ Nathaniel ? ” inquired Yossarian innocently . Clevinger skirted trap neatly . “ You think everybody Jehovah . You ’ better Raskolnkov- “ “ Who ? ” “ -yes , Raskolnikov , who- “ “ Raskolnikov ! ” “ -who-I mean it-who felt could justify killing old woman- “ “ No better ? ” “ -yes , justify , ’ right-with ax ! And I prove ! ” Gasping furiously air , Clevinger enumerated Yossarian ’ symptoms : unreasonable belief everybody around crazy , homicidal impulse machine-gun strangers , retrospective falsification , unfounded suspicion people hated conspiring kill . But Yossarian knew right , , explained Clevinger , best knowledge never wrong . Everywhere looked nut , sensible young gentleman like could maintain perspective amid much madness . And urgent , knew life peril . Yossarian eyed everyone saw warily returned squadron hospital . Milo away , , Smyrna fig harvest . The mess hall ran smoothly Milo ’ absence . Yossarian responded ravenously pungent aroma spicy lamb still cab ambulance bouncing along knotted road lay like broken suspender hospital squadron . There shish-kabob lunch , huge , savory hunks spitted meat sizzling like devil charcoal marinating seventy-two hours secret mixture Milo stolen crooked trader Levant , served Iranian rice asparagus tips Parmesan , followed cherries jubilee dessert steaming cups fresh coffee Benedictine brandy . The meal served enormous helpings damask tablecloths skilled Italian waiters Major -- de Coverley kidnaped mainland given Milo . Yossarian gorged mess hall thought would explode sagged back contented stupor , mouth filmy succulent residue . None officers squadron ever eaten well ate regularly Milo ’ mess hall , Yossarian wondered awhile ’ perhaps worth . But burped remembered trying kill , sprinted mess hall wildly ran looking Doc Daneeka taken combat duty sent home . He found Doc Daneeka sunlight , sitting high stool outside tent . “ Fifty missions , ” Doc Daneeka told , shaking head . “ The colonel wants fifty missions. ” “ But I ’ got forty-four ! ” Doc Daneeka unmoved . He sad , birdlike man spatulate face scrubbed , tapering features well-groomed rat . “ Fifty missions , ” repeated , still shaking head . “ The colonel wants fifty missions. ” 3 HAVERMEYER Actually , one around Yossarian returned hospital Orr dead man Yossarian ’ tent . The dead man Yossarian ’ tent pest , Yossarian ’ like , even though never seen . Having lying around day annoyed Yossarian much gone orderly room several times complain Sergeant Towser , refused admit dead man even existed , , course , longer . It still frustrating try appeal directly Major Major , long bony squadron commander , looked little bit like Henry Fonda distress went jumping window office time Yossarian bullied way past Sergeant Towser speak . The dead man Yossarian ’ tent simply easy live . He even disturbed Orr , easy live , either , , day Yossarian came back , tinkering faucet fed gasoline stove started building Yossarian hospital . “ What ? ” Yossarian asked guardedly entered tent , although saw . “ There ’ leak , ” Orr said . “ I ’ trying fix it. ” “ Please stop , ” said Yossarian . “ You ’ making nervous. ” “ When I kid , ” Orr replied , “ I used walk around day crab apples cheeks . One cheek. ” Yossarian put aside musette bag begun removing toilet articles braced suspiciously . A minute passed . “ Why ? ” found forced ask finally . Orr tittered triumphantly . “ Because ’ better horse chestnuts , ” answered . Orr kneeling floor tent . He worked without pause , taking faucet apart , spreading tiny pieces carefully , counting studying one interminably though never seen anything remotely similar , reassembling whole apparatus , , loss patience interest , sign fatigue , indication ever concluding . Yossarian watched tinkering felt certain would compelled murder cold blood stop . His eyes moved toward hunting knife slung mosquito-net bar dead man day arrived . The knife hung beside dead man ’ empty leather gun holster , Havermeyer stolen gun . “ When I ’ get crab apples , ” Orr continued , “ I used horse chestnuts . Horse chestnuts size crab apples actually better shape , although shape ’ matter bit. ” “ Why walk around crab apples cheeks ? ” Yossarian asked . “ That ’ I asked. ” “ Because ’ got better shape horse chestnuts , ” Orr answered . “ I told that. ” “ Why , ” swore Yossarian approvingly , “ evil-eyed , mechanically-aptituded , disaffiliated son bitch , walk around anything cheeks ? ” “ I ’ , ” Orr said , “ walk around anything cheeks . I walked around crab apples cheeks . When I ’ get crab apples I walked around horse chestnuts . In cheeks. ” Orr giggled . Yossarian made mind keep mouth shut . Orr waited . Yossarian waited longer . “ One cheek , ” Orr said . “ Why ? ” Orr pounced . “ Why ? ” Yossarian shook head , smiling , refused say . “ It ’ funny thing valve , ” Orr mused aloud . “ What ? ” Yossarian asked . “ Because I wanted- “ Yossarian knew . “ Jesus Christ ! Why want- “ “ -apple cheeks. ” “ -apple cheeks ? ” Yossarian demanded . “ I wanted apple cheeks , ” Orr repeated . “ Even I kid I wanted apple cheeks someday , I decided work I got , God , I work I got , ’ I , crab apples cheeks day long. ” He giggled . “ One cheek. ” “ Why want apple cheeks ? ” “ I ’ want apple cheeks , ” Orr said . “ I wanted big cheeks . I ’ care color much , I wanted big . I worked like one crazy guys read go around squeezing rubber balls day long strengthen hands . In fact , I one crazy guys . I used walk around day rubber balls hands , too. ” “ Why ? ” “ Why ? ” “ Why walk around day rubber balls hands ? ” “ Because rubber balls- “ said Orr . “ -are better crab apples ? ” Orr sniggered shook head . “ I protect good reputation case anyone ever caught walking around crab apples cheeks . With rubber balls hands I could deny crab apples cheeks . Every time someone asked I walking around crab apples cheeks , I ’ open hands show rubber balls I walking around , crab apples , hands , cheeks . It good story . But I never knew got across , since ’ pretty tough make people understand ’ talking two crab apples cheeks. ” Yossarian found pretty tough understand , wondered Orr ’ talking tip tongue one apple cheeks . Yossarian decided utter another word . It would futile . He knew Orr , knew chance hell finding wanted big cheeks . It would good ask done ask whore kept beating head shoe morning Rome cramped vestibule outside open door Nately ’ whore ’ kid sister ’ room . She tall , strapping girl long hair incandescent blue veins converging populously beneath cocoa-colored skin flesh tender , kept cursing shrieking jumping high air bare feet keep right hitting top head spiked heel shoe . They naked , raising rumpus brought everyone apartment hall watch , couple bedroom doorway , naked except aproned sweatered old woman , clucked reprovingly , lecherous , dissipated old man , cackled aloud hilariously whole episode kind avid superior glee . The girl shrieked Orr giggled . Each time landed heel shoe , Orr giggled louder , infuriating still flew still higher air another shot noodle , wondrously full breasts soaring place like billowing pennants strong wind buttocks strong thighs shim-sham-shimmying way way like horrifying bonanza . She shrieked Orr giggled right time shrieked knocked cold good solid crack temple made stop giggling sent hospital stretcher hole head ’ deep mild concussion kept combat twelve days . Nobody could find happened , even cackling old man clucking old woman , position find everything happened vast endless brothel multitudinous bedrooms facing sides narrow hallways going opposite directions spacious sitting room shaded windows single lamp . Every time met Orr , ’ hoist skirts tight white elastic panties , jeering coarsely , bulge firm , round belly , cursing contemptuously roaring husky laughter saw giggle fearfully take refuge behind Yossarian . Whatever done tried failed behind closed door Nately ’ whore ’ kid sister ’ room still secret . The girl ’ tell Nately ’ whore whores Nately Yossarian . Orr might tell , Yossarian decided utter another word . “ Do want know I wanted big cheeks ? ” Orr asked . Yossarian kept mouth shut . “ Do remember , ” Orr said , “ time Rome girl ’ stand kept hitting head heel shoe ? Do want know hitting ? ” It still impossible imagine could done make angry enough hammer head fifteen twenty minutes , yet angry enough pick ankles dash brains . She certainly tall enough , Orr certainly short enough . Orr buck teeth bulging eyes go big cheeks even smaller young Huple , lived wrong side railroad tracks tent administration area Hungry Joe lay screaming sleep every night . The administration area Hungry Joe pitched tent mistake lay center squadron ditch , rusted railroad tracks , tilted black bituminous road . The men could pick girls along road promised take wanted go , buxom , young , homely , grinning girls missing teeth could drive road lie wild grass , Yossarian whenever could , nearly often Hungry Joe , could get jeep ’ drive , begged try . The tents enlisted men squadron stood side road alongside open-air movie theater , daily amusement dying , ignorant armies clashed night collapsible screen , another U.S.O . troupe came afternoon . The U.S.O . troupes sent General P. P. Peckem , moved headquarters Rome nothing better schemed General Dreedle . General Peckem general neatness definitely counted . He spry , suave precise general knew circumference equator always wrote “ enhanced ” meant “ increased ” . He prick , one knew better General Dreedle , incensed General Peckem ’ recent directive requiring tents Mediterranean theater operations pitched along parallel lines entrances facing back proudly toward Washington Monument . To General Dreedle , ran fighting outfit , seemed lot crap . Furthermore , none General Peckem ’ goddam business tents General Dreedle ’ wing pitched . There followed hectic jurisdictional dispute overlords decided General Dreedle ’ favor ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , mail clerk Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters . Wintergreen determined outcome throwing communications General Peckem wastebasket . He found prolix . General Dreedle ’ views , expressed less pretentious literary style , pleased ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen sped along zealous observance regulations . General Dreedle victorious default . To regain whatever status lost , General Peckem began sending U.S.O . troupes ever sent assigned Colonel Cargill responsibility generating enough enthusiasm . But enthusiasm Yossarian ’ group . In Yossarian ’ group mounting number enlisted men officers found way solemnly Sergeant Towser several times day ask orders sending home come . They men finished fifty missions . There Yossarian gone hospital , still waiting . They worried bit nails . They grotesque , like useless young men depression . They moved sideways , like crabs . They waiting orders sending home safety return Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters Italy , waited nothing worry bite nails find way solemnly Sergeant Towser several times day ask order sending home safety come . They race knew , knew bitter experience Colonel Cathcart might raise number missions time . They nothing better wait . Only Hungry Joe something better time finished missions . He screaming nightmares fist fights Huple ’ cat . He took camera front row every U.S.O . show tried shoot pictures skirt yellow-headed singer two big ones sequined dress always seemed ready burst . The pictures never came . Colonel Cargill , General Peckem ’ troubleshooter , forceful , ruddy man . Before war alert , hardhitting , aggressive marketing executive . He bad marketing executive . Colonel Cargill awful marketing executive services much sought firms eager establish losses tax purposes . Throughout civilized world , Battery Park Fulton Street , known dependable man fast tax write-off . His prices high , failure often come easily . He start top work way , sympathetic friends Washington , losing money simple matter . It took months hard work careful misplanning . A person misplaced , disorganized , miscalculated , overlooked everything opened every loophole , thought made , government gave lake forest oilfield spoiled everything . Even handicaps , Colonel Cargill could relied run prosperous enterprise ground . He self-made man owed lack success nobody . “ Men , ” Colonel Cargill began Yossarian ’ squadron , measuring pauses carefully . “ You ’ American officers . The officers army world make statement . Think it. ” Sergeant Knight thought politely informed Colonel Cargill addressing enlisted men officers found waiting side squadron . Colonel Cargill thanked crisply glowed self-satisfaction strode across area . It made proud observe twenty-nine months service blunted genius ineptitude . “ Men , ” began address officers , measuring pauses carefully . “ You ’ American officers . The officers army world make statement . Think it. ” He waited moment permit think . “ These people guests ! ” shouted suddenly . “ They ’ traveled three thousand miles entertain . How going feel nobody wants go watch ? What ’ going happen morale ? Now , men , ’ skin behind . But girl wants play accordion today old enough mother . How would feel mother traveled three thousand miles play accordion troops ’ want watch ? How kid whose mother accordion player old enough going feel grows learns ? We know answer one . Now , men , ’ misunderstand . This voluntary , course . I ’ last colonel world order go U.S.O . show good time , I want every one ’ sick enough hospital go U.S.O . show right good time , ’ order ! ” Yossarian feel almost sick enough go back hospital , felt even sicker three combat missions later Doc Daneeka still shook melancholy head refused ground . “ You think ’ got troubles ? ” Doc Daneeka rebuked grievingly . “ What ? I lived peanuts eight years I learned doctor . After peanuts , I lived chicken feed office I could build practice decent enough even pay expenses . Then , shop finally starting show profit , drafted . I ’ know ’ complaining about. ” Doc Daneeka Yossarian ’ friend would nothing power help . Yossarian listened carefully Doc Daneeka told Colonel Cathcart Group , wanted general , General Dreedle Wing General Dreedle ’ nurse , generals Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters , insisted forty missions completed tour duty . “ Why ’ smile make best ? ” advised Yossarian glumly . “ Be like Havermeyer. ” Yossarian shuddered suggestion . Havermeyer lead bombardier never took evasive action going target thereby increased danger men flew formation . “ Havermeyer , hell ’ ever take evasive action ? ” would demand rage mission . “ Hey , men leave Captain Havermeyer alone , ” Colonel Cathcart would order . “ He ’ best damned bombardier ’ got. ” Havermeyer grinned nodded tried explain dumdummed bullets hunting knife fired field mice tent every night . Havermeyer best damned bombardier , flew straight level way I.P . target , even far beyond target saw falling bombs strike ground explode darting spurt abrupt orange flashed beneath swirling pall smoke pulverized debris geysering wildly huge , rolling waves gray black . Havermeyer held mortal men rigid six planes steady still sitting ducks followed bombs way plexiglass nose deep interest gave German gunners time needed set sights take aim pull triggers lanyards switches whatever hell pull wanted kill people ’ know . Havermeyer lead bombardier never missed . Yossarian lead bombardier demoted longer gave damn whether missed . He decided live forever die attempt , mission time went come alive . The men loved flying behind Yossarian , used come barreling target directions every height , climbing diving twisting turning steeply sharply pilots five planes could stay formation , leveling two three seconds took bombs drop zooming aching howl engines , wrenching flight air violently wove way filthy barrages flak six planes soon flung sky like prayers , one pushover German fighters , fine Yossarian , German fighters want exploding planes near exploded . Only Sturm und Drang left far behind would tip flak helmet back wearily sweating head stop barking directions McWatt controls , nothing better wonder time like bombs fallen . “ Bomb bay clear , ” Sergeant Knight back would announce . “ Did hit bridge ? ” McWatt would ask . “ I ’ see , sir , I kept getting bounced around back pretty hard I ’ see . Everything ’ covered smoke I ’ see. ” “ Hey , Aarfy , bombs hit target ? ” “ What target ? ” Captain Aardvaark , Yossarian ’ plump , pipe-smoking navigator , would say confusion maps created Yossarian ’ side nose ship . “ I ’ think ’ target yet . Are ? ” “ Yossarian , bombs hit target ? ” “ What bombs ? ” answered Yossarian , whose concern flak . “ Oh , well , ” McWatt would sing , “ hell. ” Yossarian give damn whether hit target , long Havermeyer one lead bombardiers never go back . Every someone grew angry enough Havermeyer throw punch . “ I said men leave Captain Havermeyer alone , ” Colonel Cathcart warned angrily . “ I said ’ best damned bombardier ’ got , ’ I ? ” Havermeyer grinned colonel ’ intervention shoved another piece peanut brittle inside face . Havermeyer grown proficient shooting field mice night gun stolen dead man Yossarian ’ tent . His bait bar candy would presight darkness sat waiting nibble finger hand inside loop line run frame mosquito net chain unfrosted light bulb overhead . The line taut banjo string , merest tug would snap blind shivering quarry blaze light . Havermeyer would chortle exultantly watched tiny mammal freeze roll terrified eyes frantic search intruder . Havermeyer would wait eyes fell upon laughed aloud pulled trigger time , showering rank , furry body tent reverberating crash dispatching timid soul back Creator . Late one night , Havermeyer fired shot mouse brought Hungry Joe bolting barefoot , ranting top screechy voice emptying own.45 Havermeyer ’ tent came charging one side ditch vanished inside one slit trenches appeared like magic beside every tent morning Milo Minderbinder bombed squadron . It dawn Great Big Siege Bologna , tongueless dead men peopled night hours like living ghosts Hungry Joe half mind finished missions scheduled fly . Hungry Joe babbling incoherently fished dank bottom slit trench , babbling snakes , rats spiders . The others flashed searchlights make sure . There nothing inside inches stagnant rain water . “ You see ? ” cried Havermeyer . “ I told . I told crazy , ’ I ? ” 4 DOC DANEEKA Hungry Joe crazy , one knew better Yossarian , everything could help . Hungry Joe ’ listen Yossarian . Hungry Joe ’ listen thought Yossarian crazy . “ Why listen ? ” Doc Daneeka inquired Yossarian without looking . “ Because ’ got troubles. ” Doc Daneeka snorted scornfully . “ He thinks ’ got troubles ? What ? ” Doc Daneeka continued slowly gloomy sneer . “ Oh , I ’ complaining . I know ’ war . I know lot people going suffer us win . But must I one ? Why ’ draft old doctors keep shooting kissers public big sacrifices medical game stands ready make ? I ’ want make sacrifices . I want make dough. ” Doc Daneeka neat , clean man whose idea good time sulk . He dark complexion small , wise , saturnine face mournful pouches eyes . He brooded health continually went almost daily medical tent temperature taken one two enlisted men ran things practically , ran efficiently left little else sit sunlight stuffed nose wonder people worried . Their names Gus Wes succeeded elevating medicine exact science . All men reporting sick call temperatures 102 rushed hospital . All except Yossarian reporting sick call temperatures 102 gums toes painted gentian violet solution given laxative throw away bushes . All reporting sick call temperatures exactly 102 asked return hour temperatures taken . Yossarian , temperature 101 , could go hospital whenever wanted afraid . The system worked fine everybody , especially Doc Daneeka , found time needed watch old Major -- de Coverley pitching horseshoes private horseshoe-pitching pit , still wearing transparent eye patch Doc Daneeka fashioned strip celluloid stolen Major Major ’ orderly room window months Major -- de Coverley returned Rome injured cornea renting two apartments officers enlisted men use rest leaves . The time Doc Daneeka ever went medical tent time began feel sick man day stopped Gus Wes look . They could never find anything wrong . His temperature always 96.8 , perfectly right , long ’ mind . Doc Daneeka mind . He beginning lose confidence Gus Wes thinking transferred back motor pool replaced someone could find something wrong . Doc Daneeka personally familiar number things drastically wrong . In addition health , worried Pacific Ocean flight time . Health something one ever could sure long enough time . The Pacific Ocean body water surrounded sides elephantiasis dread diseases , ever displeased Colonel Cathcart grounding Yossarian , might suddenly find transferred . And flight time time spend airplane flight month order get flight pay . Doc Daneeka hated fly . He felt imprisoned airplane . In airplane absolutely place world go except another part airplane . Doc Daneeka told people enjoyed climbing airplane really giving vent subconscious desire climb back womb . He told Yossarian , made possible Dan Daneeka collect flight pay month without ever climbing back womb . Yossarian would persuade McWatt enter Doc Daneeka ’ name flight log training missions trips Rome . “ You know , ” Doc Daneeka wheedled , sly , conspiratorial wink . “ Why take chances I ’ ? ” “ Sure , ” Yossarian agreed . “ What difference make anyone I ’ plane ? ” “ No difference. ” “ Sure , ’ I mean , ” Doc Daneeka said . “ A little grease makes world go round . One hand washes . Know I mean ? You scratch back , I ’ scratch yours. ” Yossarian knew meant . “ That ’ I meant , ” Doc Daneeka said , Yossarian began scratching back . “ I ’ talking co-operation . Favors . You favor , I ’ one . Get ? ” “ Do one , ” Yossarian requested . “ Not chance , ” Doc Daneeka answered . There something fearful minute Doc Daneeka sat despondently outside tent sunlight often could , dressed khaki summer trousers short-sleeved summer shirt bleached almost antiseptic gray daily laundering subjected . He like man grown frozen horror never come completely unthawed . He sat tucked , slender shoulders huddled halfway around head , suntanned hands luminous silver fingernails massaging backs bare , folded arms gently though cold . Actually , warm , compassionate man never stopped feeling sorry . “ Why ? ” constant lament , question good one . Yossarian knew good one Yossarian collector good questions used disrupt educational sessions Clevinger conducted two nights week Captain Black ’ intelligence tent corporal eyeglasses everybody knew probably subversive . Captain Black knew subversive wore eyeglasses used words like panacea utopia , disapproved Adolf Hitler , done great job combating un-American activities Germany . Yossarian attended educational sessions wanted find many people working hard kill . A handful men also interested , questions many good Clevinger subversive corporal finished made mistake asking . “ Who Spain ? ” “ Why Hitler ? ” “ When right ? ” “ Where stooped mealy-colored old man I used call Poppa merry-go-round broke ? ” “ How trump Munich ? ” “ Ho-ho beriberi. ” “ Balls ! ” rang rapid succession , Yossarian question answer : “ Where Snowdens yesteryear ? ” The question upset , Snowden killed Avignon Dobbs went crazy mid-air seized controls away Huple . The corporal played dumb . “ What ? ” asked . “ Where Snowdens yesteryear ? ” “ I ’ afraid I ’ understand. ” “ Où sont les Neigedens ’ antan ? ” Yossarian said make easier . “ Parlez en anglais , Christ ’ sake , ” said corporal . “ Je ne parle pas français. ” “ Neither I , ” answered Yossarian , ready pursue words world wring knowledge could , Clevinger intervened , pale , thin , laboring breath , humid coating tears already glistening undernourished eyes . Group Headquarters alarmed , telling people might find felt free ask whatever questions wanted . Colonel Cathcart sent Colonel Korn stop , Colonel Korn succeeded rule governing asking questions . Colonel Korn ’ rule stroke genius , Colonel Korn explained report Colonel Cathcart . Under Colonel Korn ’ rule , people permitted ask questions never . Soon people attending never asked questions , sessions discontinued altogether , since Clevinger , corporal Colonel Korn agreed neither possible necessary educate people never questioned anything . Colonel Cathcart Lieutenant Colonel Korn lived worked Group Headquarters building , members headquarters staff , exception chaplain . The Group Headquarters building enormous , windy , antiquated structure built powdery red stone banging plumbing . Behind building modern skeet-shooting range constructed Colonel Cathcart exclusive recreation officers Group every officer enlisted man combat status , thanks General Dreedle , spend minimum eight hours month . Yossarian shot skeet , never hit . Appleby shot skeet never missed . Yossarian bad shooting skeet gambling . He could never win money gambling either . Even cheated ’ win , people cheated always better cheating . These two disappointments resigned : would never skeet shooter , would never make money . “ It takes brains make money , ” Colonel Cargill wrote one homiletic memoranda regularly prepared circulation General Peckem ’ signature . “ Any fool make money days . But people talent brains ? Name , example , one poet makes money. ” “ T . S. Eliot , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen said mail-sorting cubicle Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters , slammed telephone without identifying . Colonel Cargill , Rome , perplexed . “ Who ? ” asked General Peckem . “ I ’ know , ” Colonel Cargill replied . “ What want ? ” “ I ’ know. ” “ Well , say ? ” “ ’ T . S. Eliot , ’ ” Colonel Cargill informed . “ What ’ ? ” “ ’ T . S. Eliot , ’ ” Colonel Cargill repeated . “ Just ‘ T . S. ’ - “ “ Yes , sir . That ’ said . Just ‘ T . S. Eliot. ’ ” “ I wonder means , ” General Peckem reflected . Colonel Cargill wondered , . “ T . S. Eliot , ” General Peckem mused . “ T . S. Eliot , ” Colonel Cargill echoed funereal puzzlement . General Peckem roused moment unctuous benignant smile . His expression shrewd sophisticated . His eyes gleamed maliciously . “ Have someone get General Dreedle , ” requested Colonel Cargill . “ Don ’ let know ’ calling. ” Colonel Cargill handed phone . “ T . S. Eliot , ” General Peckem said , hung . “ Who ? ” asked Colonel Moodus . General Dreedle , Corsica , reply . Colonel Moodus General Dreedle ’ son-in-law , General Dreedle , insistence wife better judgment , taken military business . General Dreedle gazed Colonel Moodus level hatred . He detested sight son-in-law , aide therefore constant attendance upon . He opposed daughter ’ marriage Colonel Moodus disliked attending weddings . Wearing menacing preoccupied scowl , General Dreedle moved full-length mirror office stared stocky reflection . He grizzled , broad-browed head iron-gray tufts eyes blunt belligerent jaw . He brooded ponderous speculation cryptic message received . Slowly face softened idea , curled lips wicked pleasure . “ Get Peckem , ” told Colonel Moodus . “ Don ’ let bastard know ’ calling. ” “ Who ? ” asked Colonel Cargill , back Rome . “ That person , ” General Peckem replied definite trace alarm . “ Now ’ me. ” “ What want ? ” “ I ’ know. ” “ What say ? ” “ The thing. ” “ ’ T . S. Eliot ’ ? ” “ Yes , ‘ T . S. Eliot. ’ That ’ said. ” General Peckem hopeful thought . “ Perhaps ’ new code something , like colors day . Why ’ someone check Communications see ’ new code something colors day ? ” Communications answered T. S. Eliot new code colors day . Colonel Cargill next idea . “ Maybe I ought phone Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters see know anything . They clerk named Wintergreen I ’ pretty close . He ’ one tipped prose prolix. ” Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen told Cargill record Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters T. S. Eliot . “ How ’ prose days ? ” Colonel Cargill decided inquire ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen phone . “ It ’ much better , ’ ? ” “ It ’ still prolix , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen replied . “ It ’ surprise General Dreedle behind whole thing , ” General Peckem confessed last . “ Remember skeet-shooting range ? ” General Dreedle thrown open Colonel Cathcart ’ private skeet-shooting range every officer enlisted man group combat duty . General Dreedle wanted men spend much time skeet-shooting range facilities flight schedule would allow . Shooting skeet eight hours month excellent training . It trained shoot skeet . Dunbar loved shooting skeet hated every minute time passed slowly . He figured single hour skeet-shooting range people like Havermeyer Appleby could worth much eleven-times-seventeen years . “ I think ’ crazy , ” way Clevinger responded Dunbar ’ discovery . “ Who wants know ? ” Dunbar answered . “ I mean , ” Clevinger insisted . “ Who cares ? ” Dunbar answered . “ I really . I ’ even go far concede life seems longer I- “ “ -is longer I- “ “ -is longer-Is longer ? All right , longer ’ filled periods boredom discomfort , b- “ “ Guess fast ? ” Dunbar said suddenly . “ Huh ? ” “ They go , ” Dunbar explained . “ Years. ” “ Years. ” “ Years , ” said Dunbar . “ Years , years , years. ” “ Clevinger , ’ let Dunbar alone ? ” Yossarian broke . “ Don ’ realize toll taking ? ” “ It ’ right , ” said Dunbar magnanimously . “ I decades spare . Do know long year takes ’ going away ? ” “ And shut also , ” Yossarian told Orr , begun snigger . “ I thinking girl , ” Orr said . “ That girl Sicily . That girl Sicily bald head. ” “ You ’ better shut also , ” Yossarian warned . “ It ’ fault , ” Dunbar said Yossarian . “ Why ’ let snigger wants ? It ’ better talking. ” “ All right . Go ahead snigger want to. ” “ Do know long year takes ’ going away ? ” Dunbar repeated Clevinger . “ This long. ” He snapped fingers . “ A second ago stepping college lungs full fresh air . Today ’ old man. ” “ Old ? ” asked Clevinger surprise . “ What talking ? ” “ Old. ” “ I ’ old. ” “ You ’ inches away death every time go mission . How much older age ? A half minute stepping high school , unhooked brassiere close ever hoped get Paradise . Only fifth second small kid ten-week summer vacation lasted hundred thousand years still ended soon . Zip ! They go rocketing fast . How hell else ever going slow time ? ” Dunbar almost angry finished . “ Well , maybe true , ” Clevinger conceded unwillingly subdued tone . “ Maybe long life filled many unpleasant conditions ’ seem long . But event , wants one ? ” “ I , ” Dunbar told . “ Why ? ” Clevinger asked . “ What else ? ” 5 CHIEF WHITE HALFOAT Doc Daneeka lived splotched gray tent Chief White Halfoat , feared despised . “ I picture liver , ” Doc Daneeka grumbled . “ Picture liver , ” Yossarian advised . “ There ’ nothing wrong liver. ” “ That shows much ’ know , ” Yossarian bluffed , told Doc Daneeka troublesome pain liver troubled Nurse Duckett Nurse Cramer doctors hospital ’ become jaundice ’ go away . Doc Daneeka ’ interested . “ You think ’ got troubles ? ” wanted know . “ What ? You ’ office day newlyweds walked in. ” “ What newlyweds ? ” “ Those newlyweds walked office one day . Didn ’ I ever tell ? She lovely. ” So Doc Daneeka ’ office . He decorated waiting room goldfish one finest suites cheap furniture . Whatever could bought credit , even goldfish . For rest , obtained money greedy relatives exchange shares profits . His office Staten Island two-family firetrap four blocks away ferry stop one block south supermarket , three beauty parlors , two corrupt druggists . It corner location , nothing helped . Population turnover small , people clung habit physicians business years . Bills piled rapidly , soon faced loss precious medical instruments : adding machine repossessed , typewriter . The goldfish died . Fortunately , things blackest , war broke . “ It godsend , ” Doc Daneeka confessed solemnly . “ Most doctors soon service , things picked overnight . The corner location really started paying , I soon found handling patients I could handle competently . I upped kickback fee two drugstores . The beauty parlors good two , three abortions week . Things ’ better , look happened . They send guy draft board around look . I Four-F . I examined pretty thoroughly discovered I unfit military service . You ’ think word would enough , ’ , since I doctor good standing county medical society local Better Business Bureau . But , ’ , sent guy around make sure I really one leg amputated hip helplessly bedridden incurable rheumatoid arthritis . Yossarian , live age distrust deteriorating spiritual values . It ’ terrible thing , ” Doc Daneeka protested voice quavering strong emotion . “ It ’ terrible thing even word licensed physician suspected country loves. ” Doc Daneeka drafted shipped Pianosa flight surgeon , even though terrified flying . “ I ’ go looking trouble airplane , ” noted , blinking beady , brown , offended eyes myopically . “ It comes looking . Like virgin I ’ telling ’ baby. ” “ What virgin ? ” Yossarian asked . “ I thought telling newlyweds. ” “ That ’ virgin I ’ telling . They couple young kids , ’ married , oh , little year came walking office without appointment . You seen . She sweet young pretty . She even blushed I asked periods . I ’ think I ’ ever stop loving girl . She built like dream wore chain around neck medal Saint Anthony hanging inside beautiful bosom I never saw . ‘ It must terrible temptation Saint Anthony , ’ I joked-just put ease , know . ‘ Saint Anthony ? ’ husband said . ‘ Who ’ Saint Anthony ? ’ ‘ Ask wife , ’ I told . ‘ She tell Saint Anthony is. ’ ‘ Who Saint Anthony ? ’ asked . ‘ Who ? ’ wanted know . ‘ Saint Anthony , ’ told . ‘ Saint Anthony ? ’ said . ‘ Who ’ Saint Anthony ? ’ When I got good look inside examination room I found still virgin .

A days later came back told nurse see right away . As soon alone , punched nose. ” “ He ? ” “ He called wise guy punched nose . ‘ What , wise guy ? ’ said , knocked flat ass . Pow ! Just like . I ’ kidding. ” “ I know ’ kidding , ” Yossarian said . “ But ? ” “ How I know ? ” Doc Daneeka retorted annoyance . “ Maybe something Saint Anthony ? ” Doc Daneeka looked Yossarian blankly . “ Saint Anthony ? ” asked astonishment . “ Who ’ Saint Anthony ? ” “ How I know ? ” answered Chief White Halfoat , staggering inside tent bottle whiskey cradled arm sitting pugnaciously two . Doc Daneeka rose without word moved chair outside tent , back bowed compact kit injustices perpetual burden . He could bear company roommate . Chief White Halfoat thought crazy . “ I ’ know ’ matter guy , ” observed reproachfully . “ He ’ got brains , ’ ’ matter . If brains ’ grab shovel start digging . Right tent , ’ start digging , right cot . He ’ strike oil time . Don ’ know enlisted man struck oil shovel back States ? Didn ’ ever hear happened kid-what name rotten rat bastard pimp snotnose back Colorado ? ” “ Wintergreen. ” “ Wintergreen. ” “ He ’ afraid , ” Yossarian explained . “ Oh , . Not Wintergreen. ” Chief White Halfoat shook head undisguised admiration . “ That stinking little punk wise-guy son bitch ’ afraid nobody. ” “ Doc Daneeka ’ afraid . That ’ ’ matter him. ” “ What ’ afraid ? ” “ He ’ afraid , ” Yossarian said . “ He ’ afraid ’ going die pneumonia. ” “ He ’ better afraid , ” Chief White Halfoat said . A deep , low laugh rumbled massive chest . “ I , , first chance I get . You wait see. ” Chief White Halfoat handsome , swarthy Indian Oklahoma heavy , hard-boned face tousled black hair , half-blooded Creek Enid , occult reasons , made mind die pneumonia . He glowering , vengeful , disillusioned Indian hated foreigners names like Cathcart , Korn , Black Havermeyer wished ’ go back lousy ancestors come . “ You ’ believe , Yossarian , ” ruminated , raising voice deliberately bait Doc Daneeka , “ used pretty good country live loused goddam piety. ” Chief White Halfoat revenge upon white man . He could barely read write assigned Captain Black assistant intelligence officer . “ How could I learn read write ? ” Chief White Halfoat demanded simulated belligerence , raising voice Doc Daneeka would hear . “ Every place pitched tent , sank oil well . Every time sank well , hit oil . And every time hit oil , made us pack tent go someplace else . We human divining rods . Our whole family natural affinity petroleum deposits , soon every oil company world technicians chasing us around . We always move . It one hell way bring child , I tell . I ’ think I ever spent week one place. ” His earliest memory geologist . “ Every time another White Halfoat born , ” continued , “ stock market turned bullish . Soon whole drilling crews following us around equipment get jump . Companies began merge could cut number people assign us . But crowd back us kept growing . We never got good night ’ sleep . When stopped , stopped . When moved , moved , chuckwagons , bulldozers , derricks , generators . We walking business boom , began receive invitations best hotels amount business would drag town us . Some invitations mighty generous , ’ accept Indians best hotels inviting us ’ accept Indians guests . Racial prejudice terrible thing , Yossarian . It really . It ’ terrible thing treat decent , loyal Indian like nigger , kike , wop spic. ” Chief White Halfoat nodded slowly conviction . “ Then , Yossarian , finally happened-the beginning end . They began follow us around front . They would try guess going stop next would begin drilling even got , ’ stop . As soon ’ begin unroll blankets , would kick us . They confidence us . They ’ even wait strike oil kicked us . We tired almost ’ care day time ran . One morning found completely surrounded oilmen waiting us come way could kick us . Everywhere looked oilman ridge , waiting like Indians getting ready attack . It end . We ’ stay kicked . And place left us go . Only Army saved . Luckily , war broke nick time , draft board picked right middle put safely Lowery Field , Colorado . I survivor. ” Yossarian knew lying , interrupt Chief White Halfoat went claim never heard parents . That ’ bother much , though , word parents , since lied many things , could well lying . He much better acquainted fate tribe first cousins wandered away north diversionary movement pushed inadvertently Canada . When tried return , stopped border American immigration authorities would let back country . They could come back red . It horrible joke , Doc Daneeka ’ laugh Yossarian came one mission later pleaded , without real expectation success , grounded . Doc Daneeka snickered soon immersed problems , included Chief White Halfoat , challenging morning Indian wrestle , Yossarian , decided right go crazy . “ You ’ wasting time , ” Doc Daneeka forced tell . “ Can ’ ground someone ’ crazy ? ” “ Oh , sure . I . There ’ rule saying I ground anyone ’ crazy. ” “ Then ’ ground ? I ’ crazy . Ask Clevinger. ” “ Clevinger ? Where Clevinger ? You find Clevinger I ’ ask him. ” “ Then ask others . They ’ tell crazy I am. ” “ They ’ crazy. ” “ Then ’ ground ? ” “ Why ’ ask ground ? ” “ Because ’ crazy , ’ why. ” “ Of course ’ crazy , ” Doc Daneeka replied . “ I told ’ crazy , ’ I ? And ’ let crazy people decide whether ’ crazy , ? ” Yossarian looked soberly tried another approach . “ Is Orr crazy ? ” “ He sure , ” Doc Daneeka said . “ Can ground ? ” “ I sure . But first ask . That ’ part rule. ” “ Then ’ ask ? ” “ Because ’ crazy , ” Doc Daneeka said . “ He crazy keep flying combat missions close calls ’ . Sure , I ground Orr . But first ask to. ” “ That ’ grounded ? ” “ That ’ . Let ask me. ” “ And ground ? ” Yossarian asked . “ No . Then I ’ ground him. ” “ You mean ’ catch ? ” “ Sure ’ catch , ” Doc Daneeka replied . “ Catch-22 . Anyone wants get combat duty ’ really crazy. ” There one catch Catch-22 , specified concern one ’ safety face dangers real immediate process rational mind . Orr crazy could grounded . All ask ; soon , would longer crazy would fly missions . Orr would crazy fly missions sane ’ , sane fly . If flew crazy ’ ; ’ want sane . Yossarian moved deeply absolute simplicity clause Catch-22 let respectful whistle . “ That ’ catch , Catch-22 , ” observed . “ It ’ best , ” Doc Daneeka agreed . Yossarian saw clearly spinning reasonableness . There elliptical precision perfect pairs parts graceful shocking , like good modern art , times Yossarian ’ quite sure saw , way never quite sure good modern art flies Orr saw Appleby ’ eyes . He Orr ’ word take flies Appleby ’ eyes . “ Oh , ’ , right , ” Orr assured flies Appleby ’ eyes Yossarian ’ fist fight Appleby officers ’ club , “ although probably ’ even know . That ’ ’ see things really are. ” “ How come ’ know ? ” inquired Yossarian . “ Because ’ got flies eyes , ” Orr explained exaggerated patience . “ How see ’ got flies eyes ’ got flies eyes ? ” It made much sense anything else , Yossarian willing give Orr benefit doubt Orr wilderness outside New York City knew much wildlife Yossarian , Orr , unlike Yossarian ’ mother , father , sister , brother , aunt , uncle , in-law , teacher , spiritual leader , legislator , neighbor newspaper , never lied anything crucial . Yossarian mulled newfound knowledge Appleby private day two decided , good deed , pass word along Appleby . “ Appleby , ’ got flies eyes , ” whispered helpfully passed doorway parachute tent day weekly milk run Parma . “ What ? ” Appleby responded sharply , thrown confusion fact Yossarian spoken . “ You ’ got flies eyes , ” Yossarian repeated . “ That ’ probably ’ see them. ” Appleby retreated Yossarian look loathing bewilderment sulked silence jeep Havermeyer riding long , straight road briefing room , Major Danby , fidgeting group operations officer , waiting conduct preliminary briefing lead pilots , bombardiers navigators . Appleby spoke soft voice would heard driver Captain Black , stretched eyes closed front seat jeep . “ Havermeyer , ” asked hesitantly . “ Have I got flies eyes ? ” Havermeyer blinked quizzically . “ Sties ? ” asked . “ No , flies , ” told . Havermeyer blinked . “ Flies ? ” “ In eyes. ” “ You must crazy , ” Havermeyer said . “ No , I ’ crazy . Yossarian ’ crazy . Just tell I ’ got flies eyes . Go ahead . I take it. ” Havermeyer popped another piece peanut brittle mouth peered closely Appleby ’ eyes . “ I ’ see , ” announced . Appleby heaved immense sigh relief . Havermeyer tiny bits peanut brittle adhering lips , chin cheeks . “ You ’ got peanut brittle crumbs face , ” Appleby remarked . “ I ’ rather peanut brittle crumbs face flies eyes , ” Havermeyer retorted . The officers five planes flight arrived trucks general briefing took place thirty minutes later . The three enlisted men crew briefed , carried directly airfield separate planes scheduled fly day , waited around ground crew officers scheduled fly swung rattling tailgates trucks delivering time climb aboard start . Engines rolled disgruntedly lollipop-shaped hardstands , resisting first , idling smoothly awhile , planes lumbered around nosed forward lamely pebbled ground like sightless , stupid , crippled things taxied line foot landing strip took swiftly , one behind , zooming , rising roar , banking slowly formation mottled treetops , circling field even speed flights six formed setting course cerulean water first leg journey target northern Italy France . The planes gained altitude steadily nine thousand feet time crossed enemy territory . One surprising things always sense calm utter silence , broken test rounds fired machine guns , occasional toneless , terse remark intercom , , last , sobering pronouncement bombardier plane I.P . turn toward target . There always sunshine , always tiny sticking throat rarefied air . The B-25s flew stable , dependable , dull-green ships twin rudders engines wide wings . Their single fault , Yossarian sat bombardier , tight crawlway separating bombardier ’ compartment plexiglass nose nearest escape hatch . The crawlway narrow , square , cold tunnel hollowed beneath flight controls , large man like Yossarian could squeeze difficulty . A chubby , moon-faced navigator little reptilian eyes pipe like Aarfy ’ trouble , , Yossarian used chase back nose turned toward target , minutes away .

McWatt busy responding controls Yossarian ’ strident instructions Yossarian slipped plane bomb run whipped away violently around ravenous pillars exploding shells curt , shrill , obscene commands McWatt much like anguished , entreating nightmare yelpings Hungry Joe dark .

At night eerie , ear-splitting nightmares kept everyone squadron awake Huple , fifteen-year-old pilot lied age get Army lived pet cat tent Hungry Joe .

I really got ta laugh . He ’ sick ? How think I feel ? ” Hungry Joe firmly embedded calamities care Doc Daneeka felt . There noises , instance . Small ones enraged hollered hoarse Aarfy wet , sucking sounds made puffing pipe , Orr tinkering , McWatt explosive snap gave card turned dealt blackjack poker , Dobbs letting teeth chatter went blundering clumsily bumping things . Hungry Joe throbbing , ragged mass motile irritability . The steady ticking watch quiet room crashed like torture unshielded brain . “ Listen , kid , ” explained harshly Huple late one evening , “ want live tent , ’ got like I . You ’ got roll wrist watch pair wool socks every night keep bottom foot locker side room. ” Huple thrust jaw defiantly let Hungry Joe know ’ pushed around exactly told . Hungry Joe jumpy , emaciated wretch fleshless face dingy skin bone twitching veins squirming subcutaneously blackened hollows behind eyes like severed sections snake . It desolate , cratered face , sooty care like abandoned mining town . Hungry Joe ate voraciously , gnawed incessantly tips fingers , stammered , choked , itched , sweated , salivated , sprang spot spot fanatically intricate black camera always trying take pictures naked girls . They never came . He always forgetting put film camera turn lights remove cover lens opening . It ’ easy persuading naked girls pose , Hungry Joe knack . “ Me big man , ” would shout . “ Me big photographer Life magazine . Big picture heap big cover . Si , si , si ! Hollywood star . Multi dinero . Multi divorces . Multi ficky-fick day long. ” Few women anywhere could resist wily cajolery , prostitutes would spring feet eagerly hurl whatever fantastic poses requested . Women killed Hungry Joe . His response sexual beings one frenzied worship idolatry . They lovely , satisfying , maddening manifestations miraculous , instruments pleasure powerful measured , keen endured , exquisite intended employment base , unworthy man . He could interpret naked presence hands cosmic oversight destined rectified speedily , driven always make carnal use could fleeting moment two felt Someone caught wise whisked away . He could never decide whether furgle photograph , found impossible simultaneously . In fact , finding almost impossible either , scrambled powers performance compulsive need haste invariably possessed . The pictures never came , Hungry Joe never got . The odd thing civilian life Hungry Joe really photographer Life magazine . He hero , biggest hero Air Force , Yossarian felt , flown combat tours duty hero Air Force . He flown six combat tours duty . Hungry Joe finished flying first combat tour duty twenty-five missions necessary pack bags , write happy letters home begin hounding Sergeant Towser humorously arrival orders rotating back States . While waited , spent day shuffling rhythmically around entrance operations tent , making boisterous wisecracks everybody came jocosely calling Sergeant Towser lousy son bitch every time Sergeant Towser popped orderly room . Hungry Joe finished flying first twenty-five missions week Salerno beachhead , Yossarian laid hospital burst clap caught low-level mission Wac bushes supply flight Marrakech . Yossarian best catch Hungry Joe almost , flying six missions six days , twenty-third mission Arezzo , Colonel Nevers killed , close ever able come going home . The next day Colonel Cathcart , brimming tough pride new outfit celebrating assumption command raising number missions required twenty-five thirty . Hungry Joe unpacked bags rewrote happy letters home . He stopped hounding Sergeant Towser humorously . He began hating Sergeant Towser , focusing blame upon venomously , even though knew Sergeant Towser nothing arrival Colonel Cathcart delay processing shipping orders might rescued seven days earlier five times since . Hungry Joe could longer stand strain waiting shipping orders crumbled promptly ruin every time finished another tour duty . Each time taken combat status , gave big party little circle friends . He broke bottles bourbon managed buy four-day weekly circuits courier plane laughed , sang , shuffled shouted festival inebriated ecstasy could longer keep awake receded peacefully slumber . As soon Yossarian , Nately Dunbar put bed began screaming sleep . In morning stepped tent looking haggard , fearful guilt-ridden , eaten shell human building rocking perilously brink collapse . The nightmares appeared Hungry Joe celestial punctuality every single night spent squadron throughout whole harrowing ordeal flying combat missions waiting orders sending home never came . Impressionable men squadron like Dobbs Captain Flume deeply disturbed Hungry Joe ’ shrieking nightmares would begin shrieking nightmares , piercing obscenities flung air every night separate places squadron rang darkness romantically like mating calls songbirds filthy minds . Colonel Korn acted decisively arrest seemed beginning unwholesome trend Major Major ’ squadron . The solution provided Hungry Joe fly courier ship week , removing squadron four nights , remedy , like Colonel Korn ’ remedies , successful . Every time Colonel Cathcart increased number missions returned Hungry Joe combat duty , nightmares stopped Hungry Joe settled normal state terror smile relief . Yossarian read Hungry Joe ’ shrunken face like headline . It good Hungry Joe looked bad terrible Hungry Joe looked good . Hungry Joe ’ inverted set responses curious phenomenon everyone Hungry Joe , denied whole thing stubbornly . “ Who dreams ? ” answered , Yossarian asked dreamed . “ Joe , ’ go see Doc Daneeka ? ” Yossarian advised . “ Why I go see Doc Daneeka ? I ’ sick. ” “ What nightmares ? ” “ I ’ nightmares , ” Hungry Joe lied . “ Maybe something them. ” “ There ’ nothing wrong nightmares , ” Hungry Joe answered . “ Everybody nightmares. ” Yossarian thought . “ Every night ? ” asked . “ Why every night ? ” Hungry Joe demanded . And suddenly made sense . Why every night , indeed ? It made sense cry pain every night . It made sense Appleby , stickler regulations ordered Kraft order Yossarian take Atabrine tablets flight overseas Yossarian Appleby stopped talking . Hungry Joe made sense Kraft , , dead , dumped unceremoniously doom Ferrara exploding engine Yossarian took flight six planes target second time . The group missed bridge Ferrara seventh straight day bombsight could put bombs pickle barrel forty thousand feet , one whole week already passed since Colonel Cathcart volunteered men destroy bridge twenty-four hours . Kraft skinny , harmless kid Pennsylvania wanted liked , destined disappointed even humble degrading ambition . Instead liked , dead , bleeding cinder barbarous pile nobody heard last precious moments plane one wing plummeted . He lived innocuously little gone flame Ferrara seventh day , God resting , McWatt turned Yossarian guided target second bomb run Aarfy confused Yossarian unable drop bombs first time . “ I guess go back , ’ ? ” McWatt said somberly intercom . “ I guess , ” said Yossarian . “ Do ? ” said McWatt . “ Yeah. ” “ Oh , well , ” sang McWatt , “ hell. ” And back gone planes flights circled safely distance every crashing cannon Hermann Goering Division busy crashing shells time . Colonel Cathcart courage never hesitated volunteer men target available . No target dangerous group attack , shot difficult Appleby handle ping-pong table . Appleby good pilot superhuman ping-pong player flies eyes never lost point . Twenty-one serves ever took Appleby disgrace another opponent . His prowess ping-pong table legendary , Appleby every game started night Orr got tipsy gin juice smashed open Appleby ’ forehead paddle Appleby smashed back Orr ’ first five serves . Orr leaped top table hurling paddle came sailing end running broad jump feet planted squarely Appleby ’ face . Pandemonium broke loose . It took almost full minute Appleby disentangle Orr ’ flailing arms legs grope way feet , Orr held ground shirt front one hand arm drawn back fist smite dead , moment Yossarian stepped forward took Orr away . It night surprises Appleby , large Yossarian strong swung Yossarian hard could punch flooded Chief White Halfoat joyous excitement turned busted Colonel Moodus nose punch filled General Dreedle mellow gratification Colonel Cathcart throw chaplain officers ’ club ordered Chief White Halfoat moved Doc Daneeka ’ tent , could doctor ’ care twenty-four hours day kept good enough physical condition bust Colonel Moodus nose whenever General Dreedle wanted . Sometimes General Dreedle made special trips Wing Headquarters Colonel Moodus nurse Chief White Halfoat bust son-in-law nose . Chief White Halfoat would much rather remained trailer shared Captain Flume , silent , haunted squadron public-relations officer spent evening developing pictures took day sent publicity releases . Captain Flume spent much evening could working darkroom lay cot fingers crossed rabbit ’ foot around neck tried might stay awake . He lived mortal fear Chief White Halfoat . Captain Flume obsessed idea Chief White Halfoat would tiptoe cot one night sound asleep slit throat open ear ear . Captain Flume obtained idea Chief White Halfoat , tiptoe cot one night dozing , hiss portentously one night , Captain Flume , sound asleep , Chief White Halfoat , going slit throat open ear ear . Captain Flume turned ice , eyes , flung open wide , staring directly Chief White Halfoat ’ , glinting drunkenly inches away . “ Why ? ” Captain Flume managed croak finally . “ Why ? ” Chief White Halfoat ’ answer . Each night , Captain Flume forced keep awake long possible . He aided immeasurably Hungry Joe ’ nightmares . Listening intently Hungry Joe ’ maniacal howling night night , Captain Flume grew hate began wishing Chief White Halfoat would tiptoe cot one night slit throat open ear ear . Actually , Captain Flume slept like log nights merely dreamed awake . So convincing dreams lying awake woke morning complete exhaustion fell right back sleep . Chief White Halfoat grown almost fond Captain Flume since amazing metamorphosis . Captain Flume entered bed night buoyant extrovert left next morning brooding introvert , Chief White Halfoat proudly regarded new Captain Flume creation . He never intended slit Captain Flume ’ throat open ear ear . Threatening merely idea joke , like dying pneumonia , busting Colonel Moodus nose challenging Doc Daneeka Indian wrestle . All Chief White Halfoat wanted staggered drunk night go right sleep , Hungry Joe often made impossible . Hungry Joe ’ nightmares gave Chief White Halfoat heebie-jeebies , often wished someone would tiptoe Hungry Joe ’ tent , lift Huple ’ cat face slit throat open ear ear , everybody squadron Captain Flume could get good night ’ sleep . Even though Chief White Halfoat kept busting Colonel Moodus nose General Dreedle ’ benefit , still outside pale . Also outside pale Major Major , squadron commander , found time found squadron commander Colonel Cathcart , came blasting squadron hopped-up jeep day Major Duluth killed Perugia . Colonel Cathcart slammed screeching stop inches short railroad ditch separating nose jeep lopsided basketball court side , Major Major eventually driven kicks shoves stones punches men almost become friends . “ You ’ new squadron commander , ” Colonel Cathcart bellowed across ditch . “ But ’ think means anything , ’ . All means ’ new squadron commander. ” And Colonel Cathcart roared away abruptly ’ come , whipping jeep around vicious spinning wheels sent spray fine grit blowing Major Major ’ face . Major Major immobilized news . He stood speechless , lanky gawking , scuffed basketball long hands seeds rancor sown swiftly Colonel Cathcart took root soldiers around playing basketball let come close making friends anyone ever let come . The whites moony eyes grew large misty mouth struggled yearningly lost familiar , impregnable loneliness drifting around like suffocating fog . Like officers Group Headquarters except Major Danby , Colonel Cathcart infused democratic spirit : believed men created equal , therefore spurned men outside Group Headquarters equal fervor . Nevertheless , believed men . As told frequently briefing room , believed least ten missions better outfit felt share confidence placed could get hell . The way could get hell , though , Yossarian learned flew visit ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , flying extra ten missions . “ I still ’ get , ” Yossarian protested . “ Is Doc Daneeka right ’ ? ” “ How many say ? ” “ Forty. ” “ Daneeka telling truth , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen admitted . “ Forty missions fly far Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters concerned. ” Yossarian jubilant . “ Then I go home , right ? I ’ got forty-eight. ” “ No , ’ go home , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen corrected . “ Are crazy something ? ” “ Why ? ” “ Catch-22. ” “ Catch-22 ? ” Yossarian stunned . “ What hell Catch-22 got ? ” “ Catch-22 , ” Doc Daneeka answered patiently , Hungry Joe flown Yossarian back Pianosa , “ says ’ always got commanding officer tells to. ” “ But Twenty-seventh Air Force says I go home forty missions. ” “ But ’ say go home . And regulations say obey every order . That ’ catch . Even colonel disobeying Twenty-seventh Air Force order making fly missions , ’ still fly , ’ guilty disobeying order . And Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters would really jump you. ” Yossarian slumped disappointment . “ Then I really fly fifty missions , ’ I ? ” grieved . “ The fifty-five , ” Doc Daneeka corrected . “ What fifty-five ? ” “ The fifty-five missions colonel wants fly. ” Hungry Joe heaved huge sigh relief heard Doc Daneeka broke grin . Yossarian grabbed Hungry Joe neck made fly right back ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . “ What would , ” asked confidential tones , “ I refused fly ? ” “ We ’ probably shoot , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen replied . “ We ? ” Yossarian cried surprise . “ What mean , ? Since side ? ” “ If ’ going shot , whose side expect ? ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen retorted . Yossarian winced . Colonel Cathcart raised . 7 McWATT Ordinarily , Yossarian ’ pilot McWatt , , shaving loud red , clean pajamas outside tent morning , one odd , ironic , incomprehensible things surrounding Yossarian . McWatt craziest combat man probably , perfectly sane still mind war . He short-legged , wide-shouldered , smiling young soul whistled bouncy show tunes continuously turned cards sharp snaps dealt blackjack poker Hungry Joe disintegrated quaking despair finally beneath cumulative impact began ranting stop snapping cards . “ You son bitch , hurts , ” Hungry Joe would yell furiously , Yossarian held back soothingly one hand . “ That ’ reason , likes hear scream-you goddam son bitch ! ” McWatt crinkled fine , freckled nose apologetically vowed snap cards , always forgot . McWatt wore fleecy bedroom slippers red pajamas slept freshly pressed colored bedsheets like one Milo retrieved half grinning thief sweet tooth exchange none pitted dates Milo borrowed Yossarian . McWatt deeply impressed Milo , , amusement Corporal Snark , mess sergeant , already buying eggs seven cents apiece selling five cents . But McWatt never impressed Milo Milo letter Yossarian obtained liver Doc Daneeka . “ What ’ ? ” Milo cried alarm , came upon enormous corrugated carton filled packages dried fruit cans fruit juices desserts two Italian laborers Major -- de Coverley kidnaped kitchen carry Yossarian ’ tent . “ This Captain Yossarian , sir , ” said Corporal Snark superior smirk . Corporal Snark intellectual snob felt twenty years ahead time enjoy cooking masses . “ He letter Doc Daneeka entitling fruit fruit juices wants. ” “ What ’ ? ” cried Yossarian , Milo went white began sway . “ This Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder , sir , ” said Corporal Snark derisive wink . “ One new pilots . He became mess officer hospital last time. ” “ What ’ ? ” cried McWatt , late afternoon , Milo handed half bedsheet . “ It ’ half bedsheet stolen tent morning , ” Milo explained nervous self-satisfaction , rusty mustache twitching rapidly . “ I ’ bet ’ even know stolen. ” “ Why anyone want steal half bedsheet ? ” Yossarian asked . Milo grew flustered . “ You ’ understand , ” protested . And Yossarian also understand Milo needed desperately invest letter Doc Daneeka , came right point . “ Give Yossarian dried fruit fruit juices wants , ” Doc Daneeka written . “ He says liver condition. ” “ A letter like , ” Milo mumbled despondently , “ could ruin mess officer world. ” Milo come Yossarian ’ tent read letter , following carton lost provisions across squadron like mourner . “ I give much ask . Why , letter ’ even say eat yourself. ” “ And ’ good thing ’ , ” Yossarian told , “ I never eat . I liver condition. ” “ Oh , yes , I forgot , ” said Milo , voice lowered deferentially . “ Is bad ? ” “ Just bad enough , ” Yossarian answered cheerfully . “ I see , ” said Milo . “ What mean ? ” “ It means ’ better… ” “ I ’ think I understand. ” “ …without worse . Now see ? ” “ Yes , I see . But I still ’ think I understand. ” “ Well , ’ let trouble . Let trouble . You see , I ’ really liver condition . I ’ got symptoms . I Garnett-Fleischaker syndrome. ” “ I see , ” said Milo . “ And Garnett-Fleischaker syndrome ? ” “ A liver condition. ” “ I see , ” said Milo , began massaging black eyebrows together wearily expression interior pain , though waiting stinging discomfort experiencing go away . “ In case , ” continued finally , “ I suppose careful eat , ’ ? . “ Very careful indeed , ” Yossarian told . “ A good Garnett-Fleischaker syndrome ’ easy come , I ’ want ruin mine . That ’ I never eat fruit. ” “ Now I see , ” said Milo . “ Fruit bad liver ? ” “ No , fruit good liver . That ’ I never eat any. ” “ Then ? ” demanded Milo , plodding along doggedly mounting confusion fling question burning lips . “ Do sell ? ” “ I give away. ” “ To ? ” cried Milo , voice cracking dismay . “ To anyone wants , ” Yossarian shouted back . Milo let long , melancholy wail staggered back , beads perspiration popping suddenly ashen face . He tugged unfortunate mustache absently , whole body trembling . “ I give great deal Dunbar , ” Yossarian went . “ Dunbar ? ” Milo echoed numbly . “ Yes . Dunbar eat fruit wants ’ damned bit good . I leave carton right open anyone wants come help . Aarfy comes get prunes says never gets enough prunes mess hall . You might look ’ got time ’ fun Aarfy hanging around . Whenever supply runs low I Corporal Snark fill . Nately always takes whole load fruit along whenever goes Rome . He ’ love whore hates ’ interested . She ’ got kid sister never leaves alone bed together , live apartment old man woman bunch girls nice fat thighs always kidding around also . Nately brings whole cartonful every time goes. ” “ Does sell ? ” “ No , gives them. ” Milo frowned . “ Well , I suppose ’ generous , ” remarked enthusiasm . “ Yes , generous , ” Yossarian agreed . “ And I ’ sure ’ perfectly legal , ” said Milo , “ since food get . I suppose conditions hard , people glad get it. ” “ Yes , glad , ” Yossarian assured . “ The two girls sell black market use money buy flashy costume jewelry cheap perfume. ” Milo perked . “ Costume jewelry ! ” exclaimed . “ I ’ know . How much paying cheap perfume ? ” “ The old man uses share buy raw whiskey dirty pictures . He ’ lecher. ” “ A lecher ? ” “ You ’ surprised. ” “ Is much market Rome dirty pictures ? ” Milo asked . “ You ’ surprised . Take Aarfy , instance . Knowing , ’ never suspect , would ? ” “ That ’ lecher ? ” “ No , ’ navigator . You know Captain Aardvaark , ’ ? He ’ nice guy came first day squadron said , ‘ Aardvaark ’ name , navigation game. ’ He wore pipe face probably asked college went . Do know ? ” Milo paying attention . “ Let partner , ” blurted imploringly . Yossarian turned , even though doubt truckloads fruit would dispose way saw fit Yossarian requisitioned mess hall Doc Daneeka ’ letter . Milo crestfallen , moment trusted Yossarian every secret one , reasoning shrewdly anyone would steal country loved would steal anybody . Milo trusted Yossarian every secret location holes hills began burying money returned Smyrna planeload figs learned Yossarian C.I.D . man come hospital . To Milo , gullible enough volunteer , position mess officer sacred trust . “ I ’ even realize ’ serving enough prunes , ” admitted first day . “ I suppose ’ I ’ still new . I ’ raise question first chef. ” Yossarian eyed sharply . “ What first chef ? ” demanded . “ You ’ first chef. ” “ Corporal Snark , ” Milo explained , looking away little guiltily . “ He ’ chef I , really first chef , although I hope move administrative side . Corporal Snark tends little creative , I feel . He thinks mess sergeant sort art form always complaining prostitute talents . Nobody asking thing ! Incidentally , happen know busted private corporal ? ” “ Yes , ” said Yossarian . “ He poisoned squadron. ” Milo went pale . “ He ? ” “ He mashed hundreds cakes GI soap sweet potatoes show people taste Philistines ’ know difference good bad . Every man squadron sick . Missions canceled. ” “ Well ! ” Milo exclaimed , thin-upped disapproval . “ He certainly found wrong , ’ ? ” “ On contrary , ” Yossarian corrected . “ He found right . We packed away plateful clamored . We knew sick , idea ’ poisoned. ” Milo sniffed consternation twice , like shaggy brown hare . “ In case , I certainly want get administrative side . I ’ want anything like happening I ’ charge . You see , ” confided earnestly , “ I hope give men squadron best meals whole world . That ’ really something shoot , ’ ? If mess officer aims anything less , seems , right mess officer . Don ’ agree ? ” Yossarian turned slowly gaze Milo probing distrust . He saw simple , sincere face incapable subtlety guile , honest , frank face disunited large eyes , rusty hair , black eyebrows unfortunate reddish-brown mustache . Milo long , thin nose sniffing , damp nostrils heading sharply right , always pointing away rest looking . It face man hardened integrity could consciously violate moral principles virtue rested could transform despicable toad . One moral principles never sin charge much traffic would bear . He capable mighty paroxysms righteous indignation , indignant could learned C.I.D . man area looking . “ He ’ looking , ” Yossarian said , trying placate . “ He ’ looking someone hospital ’ signing Washington Irving ’ name letters ’ censoring. ” “ I never signed Washington Irving ’ name letters , ” Milo declared . “ Of course not. ” “ But ’ trick get confess I ’ making money black market. ” Milo hauled violently disheveled hunk off-colored mustache . “ I ’ like guys like . Always snooping around people like us . Why ’ government get ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , wants good ? He ’ got respect rules regulations keeps cutting prices me. ” Milo ’ mustache unfortunate separated halves never matched . They like Milo ’ disunited eyes , never looked thing time . Milo could see things people , could see none distinctly . In contrast reaction news C.I.D . man , learned calm courage Yossarian Colonel Cathcart raised number missions fifty-five . “ We ’ war , ” said . “ And ’ use complaining number missions fly . If colonel says fly fifty-five missions , fly them. ” “ Well , I ’ fly , ” Yossarian vowed . “ I ’ go see Major Major. ” “ How ? Major Major never sees anybody. ” “ Then I ’ go back hospital. ” “ You came hospital ten days ago , ” Milo reminded reprovingly . “ You ’ keep running hospital every time something happens ’ like . No , best thing fly missions . It ’ duty. ” Milo rigid scruples would even allow borrow package pitted dates mess hall day McWatt ’ stolen bedsheet , food mess hall still property government . “ But I borrow , ” explained Yossarian , “ since fruit get Doctor Daneeka ’ letter . You whatever want , even sell high profit instead giving away free . Wouldn ’ want together ? ” “ No. ” Milo gave . “ Then lend one package pitted dates , ” requested . “ I ’ give back . I swear I , ’ little something extra you. ” Milo proved good word handed Yossarian quarter McWatt ’ yellow bedsheet returned unopened package dates grinning thief sweet tooth stolen bedsheet McWatt ’ tent . The piece bedsheet belonged Yossarian . He earned napping , although understand . Neither McWatt . “ What ’ ? ” cried McWatt , staring mystification ripped half bedsheet . “ It ’ half bedsheet stolen tent morning , ” Milo explained . “ I ’ bet ’ even know stolen. ” “ Why anyone want steal half bedsheet ? ” Yossarian asked . Milo grew flustered . “ You ’ understand , ” protested . “ He stole whole bedsheet , I got back package pitted dates invested . That ’ quarter bedsheet . You made handsome return investment , particularly since ’ gotten back every pitted date gave me. ” Milo next addressed McWatt . “ Half bedsheet begin , I really ’ understand ’ complaining , since ’ part Captain Yossarian I ’ intervened behalf. ” “ Who ’ complaining ? ” McWatt exclaimed . “ I ’ trying figure I half bedsheet. ” “ There lots things half bedsheet , ” Milo assured . “ The remaining quarter bedsheet I ’ set aside reward enterprise , work initiative . It ’ , understand , syndicate . That ’ something might half bedsheet . You leave syndicate watch grow. ” “ What syndicate ? ” “ The syndicate I ’ like form someday I give men good food deserve. ” “ You want form syndicate ? ” “ Yes , I . No , mart . Do know mart ? ” “ It ’ place buy things , ’ ? ” “ And sell things , ” corrected Milo . “ And sell things. ” “ All life I ’ wanted mart . You lots things ’ got mart . But ’ got mart. ” “ You want mart ? ” “ And every man share. ” Yossarian still puzzled , business matter , much business matters always puzzled . “ Let try explain , ” Milo offered growing weariness exasperation , jerking thumb toward thief sweet tooth , still grinning beside . “ I knew wanted dates bedsheet . Since ’ understand word English , I made point conduct whole transaction English. ” “ Why ’ hit head take bedsheet away ? ” Yossarian asked . Pressing lips together dignity , Milo shook head . “ That would unjust , ” scolded firmly . “ Force wrong , two wrongs never make right . It much better way . When I held dates reached bedsheet , probably thought I offering trade. ” “ What ? ” “ Actually , I offering trade , since ’ understand English , I always deny it. ” “ Suppose gets angry wants dates ? ” “ Why , ’ hit head take away , ” Milo answered without hesitation . He looked Yossarian McWatt back . “ I really ’ see everyone complaining . We ’ much better . Everybody happy thief , ’ sense worrying , since ’ even speak language deserves whatever gets . Don ’ understand ? ” But Yossarian still ’ understand either Milo could buy eggs Malta seven cents apiece sell profit Pianosa five cents . 8 LIEUTENANT SCHEISSKOPF Not even Clevinger understood Milo could , Clevinger knew everything . Clevinger knew everything war except Yossarian die Corporal Snark allowed live , Corporal Snark die Yossarian allowed live . It vile muddy war , Yossarian could lived without it-lived forever , perhaps . Only fraction countrymen would give lives win , ambition among . To die die , question , Clevinger grew limp trying answer . History demand Yossarian ’ premature demise , justice could satisfied without , progress hinge upon , victory depend . That men would die matter necessity ; men would die , though , matter circumstance , Yossarian willing victim anything circumstance . But war . Just could find favor paid well liberated children pernicious influence parents . Clevinger knew much Clevinger genius pounding heart blanching face . He gangling , gawky , feverish , famish-eyed brain . As Harvard undergraduate prizes scholarship everything , reason prizes scholarship everything else busy signing petitions , circulating petitions challenging petitions , joining discussion groups resigning discussion groups , attending youth congresses , picketing youth congresses organizing student committees defense dismissed faculty members . Everyone agreed Clevinger certain go far academic world . In short , Clevinger one people lots intelligence brains , everyone knew except soon found . In short , dope . He often looked Yossarian like one people hanging around modern museums eyes together one side face . It illusion , course , generated Clevinger ’ predilection staring fixedly one side question never seeing side . Politically , humanitarian know right left trapped uncomfortably two . He constantly defending Communist friends right-wing enemies right-wing friends Communist enemies , thoroughly detested groups , never defended anyone thought dope . He serious , earnest conscientious dope . It impossible go movie without getting involved afterwards discussion empathy , Aristotle , universals , messages obligations cinema art form materialistic society . Girls took theater wait first intermission find whether seeing good bad play , found . He militant idealist crusaded racial bigotry growing faint presence . He knew everything literature except enjoy . Yossarian tried help . “ Don ’ dope , ” counseled Clevinger cadet school Santa Ana , California . “ I ’ going tell , ” Clevinger insisted , two sat high reviewing stands looking auxiliary paradeground Lieutenant Scheisskopf raging back forth like beardless Lear . “ Why ? ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf wailed . “ Keep still , idiot , ” Yossarian advised Clevinger avuncularly . “ You ’ know ’ talking , ” Clevinger objected . “ I know enough keep still , idiot. ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf tore hair gnashed teeth . His rubbery cheeks shook gusts anguish . His problem squadron aviation cadets low morale marched atrociously parade competition took place every Sunday afternoon . Their morale low want march parades every Sunday afternoon Lieutenant Scheisskopf appointed cadet officers ranks instead permitting elect . “ I want someone tell , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf beseeched prayerfully . “ If fault , I want told. ” “ He wants someone tell , ” Clevinger said . “ He wants everyone keep still , idiot , ” Yossarian answered . “ Didn ’ hear ? ” Clevinger argued . “ I heard , ” Yossarian replied . “ I heard say loudly distinctly wants every one us keep mouths shut know ’ good us. ” “ I ’ punish , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf swore . “ He says ’ punish , ” said Clevinger . “ He ’ castrate , ” said Yossarian . “ I swear I ’ punish , ” said Lieutenant Scheisskopf . “ I ’ grateful man tells truth. ” “ He ’ hate , ” said Yossarian . “ To dying day ’ hate you. ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf R.O.T.C . graduate rather glad war broken , since gave opportunity wear officer ’ uniform every day say “ Men ” clipped , military voice bunches kids fell clutches every eight weeks way butcher ’ block . He ambitious humorless Lieutenant Scheisskopf , confronted responsibilities soberly smiled rival officer Santa Ana Army Air Force Base came lingering disease . He poor eyesight chronic sinus trouble , made war especially exciting , since danger going overseas . The best thing wife best thing wife girl friend named Dori Duz whenever could Wac uniform Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife put every weekend took every weekend every cadet husband ’ squadron wanted creep . Dori Duz lively little tart copper-green gold loved best toolsheds , phone booths , field houses bus kiosks . There little ’ tried less ’ . She shameless , slim , nineteen aggressive . She destroyed egos score made men hate morning way found , used tossed aside . Yossarian loved . She marvelous piece ass found fair . He loved feel springy muscle beneath skin everywhere touched time ’ let . Yossarian loved Dori Duz much ’ help flinging passionately top Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife every week revenge upon Lieutenant Scheisskopf way Lieutenant Scheisskopf revenging upon Clevinger . Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife revenging upon Lieutenant Scheisskopf unforgettable crime ’ recall . She plump , pink , sluggish girl read good books kept urging Yossarian bourgeois without r. She never without good book close , even lying bed nothing Yossarian Dori Duz ’ dog tags . She bored Yossarian , love , . She crazy mathematics major Wharton School Business could count twenty-eight month without getting trouble . “ Darling , ’ going baby , ” would say Yossarian every month . “ You ’ goddam head , ” would reply . “ I mean , baby , ” insisted . “ So I. ” “ Darling , ’ going baby , ” would say husband . “ I ’ time , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf would grumble petulantly . “ Don ’ know ’ parade going ? ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf cared deeply winning parades bringing Clevinger charges Action Board conspiring advocate overthrow cadet officers Lieutenant Scheisskopf appointed . Clevinger troublemaker wise guy . Lieutenant Scheisskopf knew Clevinger might cause even trouble ’ watched . Yesterday cadet officers ; tomorrow might world . Clevinger mind , Lieutenant Scheisskopf noticed people minds tended get pretty smart times . Such men dangerous , even new cadet officers Clevinger helped office eager give damning testimony . The case Clevinger open shut . The thing missing something charge . It could anything parades , Clevinger took parades almost seriously Lieutenant Scheisskopf . The men fell parades early Sunday afternoon groped way ranks twelve outside barracks . Groaning hangovers , limped step station main paradeground , stood motionless heat hour two men sixty seventy cadet squadrons enough collapsed call day . On edge field stood row ambulances teams trained stretcher bearers walkie-talkies . On roofs ambulances spotters binoculars . A tally clerk kept score . Supervising entire phase operation medical officer flair accounting okayed pulses checked figures tally clerk . As soon enough unconscious men collected ambulances , medical officer signaled bandmaster strike band end parade . One behind , squadrons marched field , executed cumbersome turn around reviewing stand marched field back barracks . Each parading squadrons graded marched past reviewing stand , bloated colonel big fat mustache sat officers . The best squadron wing yellow pennant pole utterly worthless . The best squadron base red pennant longer pole worth even less , since pole heavier much nuisance lug around week squadron following Sunday . To Yossarian , idea pennants prizes absurd . No money went , class privileges . Like Olympic medals tennis trophies , signified owner done something benefit anyone capably everyone else . The parades seemed equally absurd . Yossarian hated parade . Parades martial . He hated hearing , hated seeing , hated tied traffic . He hated made take part . It bad enough aviation cadet without act like soldier blistering heat every Sunday afternoon . It bad enough aviation cadet obvious war would finished training . That reason volunteered cadet training first place . As soldier qualified aviation cadet training , weeks weeks waiting assignment class , weeks weeks become bombardier-navigator , weeks weeks operational training prepare overseas duty . It seemed inconceivable war could last long , God side , told , God , also told , could whatever He wanted . But war nearly , training almost complete . Lieutenant Scheisskopf longed desperately win parades sat half night working wife waited amorously bed thumbing Krafft-Ebing favorite passages . He read books marching . He manipulated boxes chocolate soldiers melted hands maneuvered ranks twelve set plastic cowboys bought mail-order house assumed name kept locked away everyone ’ eyes day . Leonardo ’ exercises anatomy proved indispensable . One evening felt need live model directed wife march around room . “ Naked ? ” asked hopefully . Lieutenant Scheisskopf smacked hands eyes exasperation . It despair Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ life chained woman incapable looking beyond dirty , sexual desires titanic struggles unattainable noble man could become heroically engaged . “ Why ’ ever whip ? ” pouted one night . “ Because I ’ time , ” snapped impatiently . “ I ’ time . Don ’ know ’ parade going ? ” And really time . There Sunday already , seven days left week get ready next parade . He idea hours went . Finishing last three successive parades given Lieutenant Scheisskopf unsavory reputation , considered every means improvement , even nailing twelve men rank long two-by-four beam seasoned oak keep line . The plan feasible , making ninety-degree turn would impossible without nickel-alloy swivels inserted small every man ’ back , Lieutenant Scheisskopf sanguine obtaining many nickel-alloy swivels Quartermaster enlisting cooperation surgeons hospital . The week Lieutenant Scheisskopf followed Clevinger ’ recommendation let men elect cadet officers , squadron yellow pennant . Lieutenant Scheisskopf elated unexpected achievement gave wife sharp crack head pole tried drag bed celebrate showing contempt sexual mores lower middle classes Western civilization . The next week squadron red flag , Lieutenant Scheisskopf beside rapture . And week squadron made history winning red pennant two weeks row ! Now Lieutenant Scheisskopf confidence enough powers spring big surprise . Lieutenant Scheisskopf discovered extensive research hands marchers , instead swinging freely , popular fashion , ought never moved three inches center thigh , meant , effect , scarcely swung . Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ preparations elaborate clandestine . All cadets squadron sworn secrecy rehearsed dead night auxiliary parade-ground . They marched darkness pitch bumped blindly , panic , learning march without swinging hands .

Clevinger guilty , course , would accused , since way prove find guilty , patriotic duty . He sentenced walk fifty-seven punishment tours . Popinjay locked taught lesson , Major Metcalf shipped Solomon Islands bury bodies . A punishment tour Clevinger fifty minutes weekend hour spent pacing back forth provost marshal ’ building ton unloaded rifle shoulder . It confusing Clevinger . There many strange things taking place , strangest , Clevinger , hatred , brutal , uncloaked , inexorable hatred members Action Board , glazing unforgiving expressions hard , vindictive surface , glowing narrowed eyes malignantly like inextinguishable coals . Clevinger stunned discover . They would lynched could . They three grown men boy , hated wished dead . They hated came , hated , hated left , carried hatred away malignantly like pampered treasure separated went solitude . Yossarian done best warn night . “ You ’ got chance , kid , ” told glumly . “ They hate Jews. ” “ But I ’ Jewish , ” answered Clevinger . “ It make difference , ” Yossarian promised , Yossarian right . “ They ’ everybody. ” Clevinger recoiled hatred though blinding light . These three men hated spoke language wore uniform , saw loveless faces set immutably cramped , mean lines hostility understood instantly nowhere world , fascist tanks planes submarines , bunkers behind machine guns mortars behind blowing flame throwers , even among expert gunners crack Hermann Goering Antiaircraft Division among grisly connivers beer halls Munich everywhere else , men hated . 9 MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR Major Major Major Major difficult time start . Like Minniver Cheevy , born late-exactly thirty-six hours late physical well-being mother , gentle , ailing woman , full day half ’ agony rigors childbirth , depleted resolve pursue argument new child ’ name . In hospital corridor , husband moved ahead unsmiling determination someone knew . Major Major ’ father towering , gaunt man heavy shoes black woolen suit . He filled birth certificate without faltering , betraying emotion handed completed form floor nurse . The nurse took without comment padded sight . He watched go , wondering underneath . Back ward , found wife lying vanquished beneath blankets like desiccated old vegetable , wrinkled , dry white , enfeebled tissues absolutely still . Her bed end ward , near cracked window thickened grime . Rain splashed moiling sky day dreary cold . In parts hospital chalky people aged , blue lips dying time . The man stood erect beside bed gazed woman long time . “ I named boy Caleb , ” announced finally soft voice . “ In accordance wishes. ” The woman made answer , slowly man smiled . He planned perfectly , wife asleep would never know lied lay sickbed poor ward county hospital . From meager beginning sprung ineffectual squadron commander spending better part working day Pianosa forging Washington Irving ’ name official documents . Major Major forged diligently left hand elude identification , insulated intrusion undesired authority camouflaged false mustache dark glasses additional safeguard detection anyone chancing peer dowdy celluloid window thief carved slice . In two low points birth success lay thirty-one dismal years loneliness frustration . Major Major born late mediocre . Some men born mediocre , men achieve mediocrity , men mediocrity thrust upon . With Major Major three . Even among men lacking distinction inevitably stood man lacking distinction rest , people met always impressed unimpressive . Major Major three strikes beginning-his mother , father Henry Fonda , bore sickly resemblance almost moment birth . Long even suspected Henry Fonda , found subject unflattering comparisons everywhere went . Total strangers saw fit deprecate , result stricken early guilty fear people obsequious impulse apologize society fact Henry Fonda . It easy task go life looking something like Henry Fonda , never thought quitting , inherited perseverance father , lanky man good sense humor . Major Major ’ father sober God-fearing man whose idea good joke lie age . He long-limbed farmer , God-fearing , freedom-loving , law-abiding rugged individualist held federal aid anyone farmers creeping socialism . He advocated thrift hard work disapproved loose women turned . His specialty alfalfa , made good thing growing . The government paid well every bushel alfalfa grow . The alfalfa grow , money government gave , spent every penny ’ earn new land increase amount alfalfa produce . Major Major ’ father worked without rest growing alfalfa . On long winter evenings remained indoors mend harness , sprang bed crack noon every day make certain chores would done . He invested land wisely soon growing alfalfa man county . Neighbors sought advice subjects , made much money therefore wise . “ As ye sow , shall ye reap , ” counseled one , everyone said , “ Amen. ” Major Major ’ father outspoken champion economy government , provided interfere sacred duty government pay farmers much could get alfalfa produced one else wanted producing alfalfa . He proud independent man opposed unemployment insurance never hesitated whine , whimper , wheedle , extort much could get whomever could . He devout man whose pulpit everywhere . “ The Lord gave us good farmers two strong hands could take much could grab , ” preached ardor courthouse steps front A amp ; P waited bad-tempered gum-chewing young cashier step outside give nasty look . “ If Lord ’ want us take much could get , ” preached , “ He ’ given us two good hands take with. ” And others murmured , “ Amen. ” Major Major ’ father Calvinist ’ faith predestination could perceive distinctly everyone ’ misfortunes expressions God ’ . He smoked cigarettes drank whiskey , thrived good wit stimulating intellectual conversation , particularly lying age telling good one God wife ’ difficulties delivering Major Major . The good one God wife ’ difficulties fact taken God six days produce whole world , whereas wife spent full day half labor produce Major Major . A lesser man might wavered day hospital corridor , weaker man might compromised excellent substitutes Drum Major , Minor Major , Sergeant Major , C. Sharp Major , Major Major ’ father waited fourteen years opportunity , person waste . Major Major ’ father good joke opportunity . “ Opportunity knocks world , ” would say . Major Major ’ father repeated good joke every opportunity . Being born sickly resemblance Henry Fonda first along series practical jokes destiny make Major Major unhappy victim throughout joyless life . Being born Major Major Major second . The fact born Major Major Major secret known father . Not Major Major enrolling kindergarten discovery real name made , effects disastrous . The news killed mother , lost live wasted away died , fine father , decided marry bad-tempered girl A amp ; P optimistic chances getting wife land without paying money flogging . On Major Major consequences slightly less severe . It harsh stunning realization forced upon tender age , realization , always led believe , Caleb Major , instead total stranger named Major Major Major knew absolutely nothing nobody else ever heard . What playmates withdrew never returned , disposed , , distrust strangers , especially one already deceived pretending someone known years . Nobody would anything . He began drop things trip . He shy hopeful manner new contact , always disappointed . Because needed friend desperately , never found one . He grew awkwardly tall , strange , dreamy boy fragile eyes delicate mouth whose tentative , groping smile collapsed instantly hurt disorder every fresh rebuff . He polite elders , disliked . Whatever elders told , . They told look leaped , always looked leaped . They told never put next day could day , never . He told honor father mother , honored father mother . He told kill , kill , got Army . Then told kill , killed . He turned cheek every occasion always unto others exactly would others unto . When gave charity , left hand never knew right hand . He never took name Lord God vain , committed adultery coveted neighbor ’ ass . In fact , loved neighbor never even bore false witness . Major Major ’ elders disliked flagrant nonconformist . Since nothing better well , well school . At state university took studies seriously suspected homosexuals Communist suspected Communists homosexual . He majored English history , mistake . “ English history ! ” roared silver-maned senior Senator state indignantly . “ What ’ matter American history ? American history good history world ! ” Major Major switched immediately American literature , F.B.I . opened file . There six people Scotch terrier inhabiting remote farmhouse Major Major called home , five Scotch terrier turned agents F.B.I . Soon enough derogatory information Major Major whatever wanted . The thing could find , however , take Army private make major four days later Congressmen nothing else minds could go trotting back forth streets Washington , D.C. , chanting , “ Who promoted Major Major ? Who promoted Major Major ? ” Actually , Major Major promoted I.B.M . machine sense humor almost keen father ’ . When war broke , still docile compliant . They told enlist , enlisted . They told apply aviation cadet training , applied aviation cadet training , next night found standing barefoot icy mud three ’ clock morning tough belligerent sergeant Southwest told could beat hell man outfit ready prove . The recruits squadron shaken roughly awake minutes sergeant ’ corporals told assemble front administration tent . It still raining Major Major . They fell ranks civilian clothes brought Army three days . Those lingered put shoes socks sent back cold , wet , dark tents remove , barefoot mud sergeant ran stony eyes faces told could beat hell man outfit . No one inclined dispute . Major Major ’ unexpected promotion major next day plunged belligerent sergeant bottomless gloom , longer able boast could beat hell man outfit . He brooded hours tent like Saul , receiving visitors , elite guard corporals stood discouraged watch outside . At three ’ clock morning found solution , Major Major recruits shaken roughly awake ordered assemble barefoot drizzly glare administration tent , sergeant already waiting , fists clenched hips cockily , eager speak could hardly wait arrive . “ Me Major Major , ” boasted , tough , clipped tones night , “ beat hell man outfit. ” The officers base took action Major Major problem later day . How could cope major like Major Major ? To demean personally would demean officers equal lesser rank . To treat courtesy , hand , unthinkable . Fortunately , Major Major applied aviation cadet training . Orders transferring away sent mimeograph room late afternoon , three ’ clock morning Major Major shaken roughly awake , bidden Godspeed sergeant placed aboard plane heading west . Lieutenant Scheisskopf turned white sheet Major Major reported California bare feet mudcaked toes . Major Major taken granted shaken roughly awake stand barefoot mud left shoes socks tent . The civilian clothing reported duty Lieutenant Scheisskopf rumpled dirty . Lieutenant Scheisskopf , yet made reputation parader , shuddered violently picture Major Major would make marching barefoot squadron coming Sunday . “ Go hospital quickly , ” mumbled , recovered sufficiently speak , “ tell ’ sick . Stay allowance uniforms catches money buy clothes . And shoes . Buy shoes. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ I ’ think call ‘ sir , ’ sir , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf pointed . “ You outrank me. ” “ Yes , sir . I may outrank , sir , ’ still commanding officer. ” “ Yes , sir , ’ right , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf agreed . “ You may outrank , sir , I ’ still commanding officer . So better I tell , sir , ’ get trouble . Go hospital tell ’ sick , sir . Stay uniform allowance catches money buy uniforms. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And shoes , sir . Buy shoes first chance get , sir. ” “ Yes , sir . I , sir. ” “ Thank , sir. ” Life cadet school Major Major different life along . Whoever always wanted someone else . His instructors gave preferred treatment every stage order push along quickly rid . In almost time pilot ’ wings found overseas , things began suddenly improve . All life , Major Major longed one thing , absorbed , Pianosa , , finally . Rank meant little men combat duty , relations officers enlisted men relaxed informal . Men whose names ’ even know said “ Hi ” invited go swimming play basketball . His ripest hours spent day-long basketball games one gave damn winning . Score never kept , number players might vary one thirty-five . Major Major never played basketball game , great , bobbing height rapturous enthusiasm helped make innate clumsiness lack experience . Major Major found true happiness lopsided basketball court officers enlisted men almost friends . If winners , losers , Major Major enjoyed every gamboling moment right till day Colonel Cathcart roared jeep Major Duluth killed made impossible ever enjoy playing basketball . “ You ’ new squadron commander , ” Colonel Cathcart shouted rudely across railroad ditch . “ But ’ think means anything , ’ . All means ’ new squadron commander. ” Colonel Cathcart nursed implacable grudge Major Major long time . A superfluous major rolls meant untidy table organization gave ammunition men Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters Colonel Cathcart positive enemies rivals . Colonel Cathcart praying stroke good luck like Major Duluth ’ death . He plagued one extra major ; opening one major . He appointed Major Major squadron commander roared away jeep abruptly come . For Major Major , meant end game . His face flushed discomfort , rooted spot disbelief rain clouds gathered . When turned teammates , encountered reef curious , reflective faces gazing woodenly morose inscrutable animosity . He shivered shame . When game resumed , good longer . When dribbled , one tried stop ; called pass , whoever ball passed ; missed basket , one raced rebound . The voice . The next day , day come back . Almost cue , everyone squadron stopped talking started staring . He walked life selfconsciously downcast eyes burning cheeks , object contempt , envy , suspicion , resentment malicious innuendo everywhere went . People hardly noticed resemblance Henry Fonda never ceased discussing , even hinted sinisterly Major Major elevated squadron commander resembled Henry Fonda . Captain Black , aspired position , maintained Major Major really Henry Fonda chickenshit admit . Major Major floundered bewilderedly one embarrassing catastrophe another . Without consulting , Sergeant Towser belongings moved roomy trailer Major Duluth occupied alone , Major Major came rushing breathlessly orderly room report theft things , young corporal scared half wits leaping feet shouting “ Attention ! ” moment appeared . Major Major snapped attention rest orderly room , wondering important personage entered behind . Minutes passed rigid silence , whole lot might stood attention till doomsday Major Danby dropped Group congratulate Major Major twenty minutes later put ease . Major Major fared even lamentably mess hall , Milo , face fluttery smiles , waiting usher proudly small table set front decorated embroidered tablecloth nosegay posies pink cut-glass vase . Major Major hung back horror , bold enough resist others watching . Even Havermeyer lifted head plate gape heavy , pendulous jaw . Major Major submitted meekly Milo ’ tugging cowered disgrace private table throughout whole meal . The food ashes mouth , swallowed every mouthful rather risk offending men connected preparation . Alone Milo later , Major Major felt protest stir first time said would prefer continue eating officers . Milo told ’ work . “ I ’ see work , ” Major Major argued . “ Nothing ever happened before. ” “ You never squadron commander before. ” “ Major Duluth squadron commander always ate table rest men. ” “ It different Major Duluth , Sir. ” “ In way different Major Duluth ? ” “ I wish ’ ask , sir , ” said Milo . “ Is I look like Henry Fonda ? ” Major Major mustered courage demand . “ Some people say Henry Fonda , ” Milo answered . “ Well , I ’ Henry Fonda , ” Major Major exclaimed , voice quavering exasperation . “ And I ’ look least bit like . And even I look like Henry Fonda , difference make ? ” “ It ’ make difference . That ’ I ’ trying tell , sir . It ’ Major Duluth. ” And ’ , Major Major , next meal , stepped food counter sit others regular tables , frozen tracks impenetrable wall antagonism thrown faces stood petrified tray quivering hands Milo glided forward wordlessly rescue , leading tamely private table . Major Major gave always ate table alone back others . He certain resented seemed good eat squadron commander . There never conversation mess tent Major Major present . He conscious officers tried avoid eating time , everyone greatly relieved stopped coming altogether began taking meals trailer . Major Major began forging Washington Irving ’ name official documents day first C.I.D . man showed interrogate somebody hospital gave idea . He bored dissatisfied new position . He made squadron commander idea supposed squadron commander , unless supposed forge Washington Irving ’ name official documents listen isolated clinks thumps Major -- de Coverley ’ horseshoes falling ground outside window small office rear orderly-room tent . He hounded incessantly impression vital duties left unfulfilled waited vain responsibilities overtake . He seldom went unless absolutely necessary , could get used stared . Occasionally , monotony broken officer enlisted man Sergeant Towser referred matter Major Major unable cope referred right back Sergeant Towser sensible disposition . Whatever supposed get done squadron commander apparently getting done without assistance . He grew moody depressed . At times thought seriously going sorrows see chaplain , chaplain seemed overburdened miseries Major Major shrank adding troubles . Besides , quite sure chaplains squadron commanders . He never quite sure Major -- de Coverley , either , , away renting apartments kidnaping foreign laborers , nothing pressing pitch horseshoes . Major Major often paid strict attention horseshoes falling softly earth riding around small steel pegs ground . He peeked Major -- de Coverley hours marveled someone august nothing important . He often tempted join Major -- de Coverley , pitching horseshoes day long seemed almost dull signing “ Major Major Major ” official documents , Major -- de Coverley ’ countenance forbidding Major Major awe approaching . Major Major wondered relationship Major -- de Coverley Major -- de Coverley ’ relationship . He knew Major -- de Coverley executive officer , know meant , could decide whether Major -- de Coverley blessed lenient superior cursed delinquent subordinate . He want ask Sergeant Towser , secretly afraid , one else could ask , least Major -- de Coverley . Few people ever dared approach Major -- de Coverley anything officer foolish enough pitch one horseshoes stricken next day worst case Pianosan crud Gus Wes even Doc Daneeka ever seen even heard . Everyone positive disease inflicted upon poor officer retribution Major -- de Coverley , although one sure . Most official documents came Major Major ’ desk concern . The vast majority consisted allusions prior communications Major Major never seen heard . There never need look , instructions invariably disregard . In space single productive minute , therefore , might endorse twenty separate documents advising pay absolutely attention others . From General Peckem ’ office mainland came prolix bulletins day headed cheery homilies “ Procrastination Thief Time ” “ Cleanliness Next Godliness. ” General Peckem ’ communications cleanliness procrastination made Major Major feel like filthy procrastinator , always got way quickly could . The official documents interested occasional ones pertaining unfortunate second lieutenant killed mission Orvieto less two hours arrived Pianosa whose partly unpacked belongings still Yossarian ’ tent . Since unfortunate lieutenant reported operations tent instead orderly room , Sergeant Towser decided would safest report never reported squadron , occasional documents relating dealt fact seemed vanished thin air , , one way , exactly happen . In long run , Major Major grateful official documents came desk , sitting office signing day long lot better sitting office day long signing . They gave something . Inevitably , every document signed came back fresh page added new signature intervals two ten days . They always much thicker formerly , sheet bearing last endorsement sheet added new endorsement sheets bearing recent endorsements officers scattered locations also occupied signing names official document . Major Major grew despondent watched simple communications swell prodigiously huge manuscripts . No matter many times signed one , always came back still another signature , began despair ever free . One day-it day C.I.D . man ’ first visit-Major Major signed Washington Irving ’ name one documents instead , see would feel . He liked . He liked much rest afternoon official documents . It act impulsive frivolity rebellion knew afterward would punished severely . The next morning entered office trepidation waited see would happen . Nothing happened . He sinned , good , none documents signed Washington Irving ’ name ever came back ! Here , last , progress , Major Major threw new career uninhibited gusto . Signing Washington Irving ’ name official documents much career , perhaps , less monotonous signing “ Major Major Major. ” When Washington Irving grow monotonous , could reverse order sign Irving Washington grew monotonous . And getting something done , none documents signed either names ever came back squadron . What come back , eventually , second C.I.D . man , masquerading pilot . The men knew C.I.D . man confided urged reveal true identity men already confided C.I.D . man . “ You ’ one squadron knows I ’ C.I.D . man , ” confided Major Major , “ ’ absolutely essential remain secret efficiency ’ impaired . Do understand ? ” “ Sergeant Towser knows. ” “ Yes , I know . I tell order get see . But I know ’ tell soul circumstances. ” “ He told , ” said Major Major . “ He told C.I.D . man outside see me. ” “ That bastard . I ’ throw security check . I ’ leave top-secret documents lying around I . At least I make report. ” “ I ’ get top-secret documents , ” said Major Major . “ That ’ kind I mean . Lock cabinet Sergeant Towser ’ get hands them. ” “ Sergeant Towser key cabinet. ” “ I ’ afraid ’ wasting time , ” said second C.I.D . man rather stiffly . He brisk , pudgy , high-strung person whose movements swift certain . He took number photostats large red expansion envelope hiding conspicuously beneath leather flight jacket painted garishly pictures airplanes flying orange bursts flak orderly rows little bombs signifying fifty-five combat missions flown . “ Have ever seen ? ” Major Major looked blank expression copies personal correspondence hospital censoring officer written “ Washington Irving ” “ Irving Washington. ” No . “ How ? ” Major Major gazed next copies official documents addressed signing signatures . “ No. ” “ Is man signed names squadron ? ” “ Which one ? There two names here. ” “ Either one . We figure Washington Irving Irving Washington one man ’ using two names throw us track . That ’ done often know. ” “ I ’ think ’ man either names squadron. ” A look disappointment crossed second C.I.D . man ’ face . “ He ’ lot cleverer thought , ” observed . “ He ’ using third name posing someone else . And I think… yes , I think I know third name is. ” With excitement inspiration , held another photostat Major Major study . “ How ? ” Major Major bent forward slightly saw copy piece V mail Yossarian blacked everything name Mary written , “ I yearn tragically . R. O. Shipman , Chaplain , U.S. Army. ” Major Major shook head . “ I ’ never seen before. ” “ Do know R. O. Shipman ? ” “ He ’ group chaplain. ” “ That locks , ” said second C.I.D . man . “ Washington Irving group chaplain. ” Major Major felt twinge alarm . “ R . O. Shipman group chaplain , ” corrected . “ Are sure ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Why group chaplain write letter ? ” “ Perhaps somebody else wrote forged name. ” “ Why somebody want forge group chaplain ’ name ? ” “ To escape detection. ” “ You may right , ” second C.I.D . man decided instant ’ hesitation , smacked lips crisply . “ Maybe ’ confronted gang , two men working together happen opposite names . Yes , I ’ sure ’ . One squadron , one hospital one chaplain . That makes three men , ’ ? Are absolutely sure never saw official documents ? ” “ I would signed I had. ” “ With whose name ? ” asked second C.I.D . man cunningly . “ Yours Washington Irving ’ ? ” “ With name , ” Major Major told . “ I ’ even know Washington Irving ’ name. ” The second C.I.D . man broke smile . “ Major , I ’ glad ’ clear . It means ’ able work together , I ’ going need every man I get . Somewhere European theater operations man ’ getting hands communications addressed . Have idea ? ” “ No. ” “ Well , I pretty good idea , ” said second C.I.D . man , leaned forward whisper confidentially . “ That bastard Towser . Why else would go around shooting mouth ? Now , keep eyes open let know minute hear anyone even talking Washington Irving . I ’ throw security check chaplain everyone else around here. ” The moment gone , first C.I.D . man jumped Major Major ’ office window wanted know second C.I.D . man . Major Major barely recognized . “ He C.I.D . man , ” Major Major told . “ Like hell , ” said first C.I.D . man . “ I ’ C.I.D . man around here. ” Major Major barely recognized wearing faded maroon corduroy bathrobe open seams arms , linty flannel pajamas , worn house slippers one flapping sole . This regulation hospital dress , Major Major recalled . The man added twenty pounds seemed bursting good health . “ I ’ really sick man , ” whined . “ I caught cold hospital fighter pilot came serious case pneumonia. ” “ I ’ sorry , ” Major Major said . “ A lot good , ” C.I.D . man sniveled . “ I ’ want sympathy . I want know I ’ going . I came warn Washington Irving seems shifted base operations hospital squadron . You ’ heard anyone around talking Washington Irving , ? ” “ As matter fact , I , ” Major Major answered . “ That man . He talking Washington Irving. ” “ Was really ? ” first C.I.D . man cried delight . “ This might needed crack case wide open ! You keep surveillance twenty-four hours day I rush back hospital write superiors instructions. ” The C.I.D . man jumped Major Major ’ office window gone . A minute later , flap separating Major Major ’ office orderly room flew open second C.I.D . man back , puffing frantically haste . Gasping breath , shouted , “ I saw man red pajamas jumping window go running road ! Didn ’ see ? ” “ He talking , ” Major Major answered . “ I thought looked mighty suspicious , man jumping window red pajamas. ” The man paced small office vigorous circles . “ At first I thought , hightailing Mexico . But I see ’ . He ’ say anything Washington Irving , ? ” “ As matter fact , ” said Major Major , “ did. ” “ He ? ” cried second C.I.D . man . “ That ’ fine ! This might break needed crack case wide open . Do know find ? ” “ At hospital . He ’ really sick man. ” “ That ’ great ! ” exclaimed second C.I.D . man . “ I ’ go right . It would best I went incognito . I ’ go explain situation medical tent send patient. ” “ They ’ send hospital patient unless I ’ sick , ” reported back Major Major . “ Actually , I pretty sick . I ’ meaning turn checkup , good opportunity . I ’ go back medical tent tell I ’ sick , I ’ get sent hospital way. ” “ Look , ” reported back Major Major purple gums . His distress inconsolable . He carried shoes socks hands , toes painted gentian-violet solution , . “ Who ever heard C.I.D . man purple gums ? ” moaned . He walked away orderly room head tumbled slit trench broke nose . His temperature still normal , Gus Wes made exception sent hospital ambulance . Major Major lied , good . He really surprised good , observed people lie , whole , resourceful ambitious successful people lie . Had told truth second C.I.D . man , would found trouble . Instead lied free continue work . He became circumspect work result visit second C.I.D . man . He signing left hand wearing dark glasses false mustache used unsuccessfully help begin playing basketball . As additional precaution , made happy switch Washington Irving John Milton . John Milton supple concise . Like Washington Irving , could reversed good effect whenever grew monotonous . Furthermore , enabled Major Major double output , John Milton much shorter either name Washington Irving ’ took much less time write . John Milton proved fruitful still one respect . He versatile , Major Major soon found incorporating signature fragments imaginary dialogues . Thus , typical endorsements official documents might read , “ John Milton sadist ” “ Have seen Milton , John ? ” One signature especially proud read , “ Is anybody John , Milton ? ” John Milton threw open whole new vistas filled charming , inexhaustible possibilities promised ward monotony forever . Major Major went back Washington Irving John Milton grew monotonous . Major Major bought dark glasses false mustache Rome final , futile attempt save swampy degradation steadily sinking . First awful humiliation Great Loyalty Oath Crusade , one thirty forty people circulating competitive loyalty oaths would even allow sign . Then , blowing , matter Clevinger ’ plane disappearing mysteriously thin air every member crew , blame strange mishap centering balefully never signed loyalty oaths . The dark glasses large magenta rims . The false black mustache flamboyant organ-grinder ’ , wore basketball game one day felt could endure loneliness longer . He affected air jaunty familiarity sauntered court prayed silently would recognized . The others pretended recognize , began fun . Just finished congratulating innocent ruse bumped hard one opponents knocked knees . Soon bumped hard , dawned recognize using disguise license elbow , trip maul . They want . And realize , players team fused instinctively players team single , howling , bloodthirsty mob descended upon sides foul curses swinging fists . They knocked ground , kicked ground , attacked struggled blindly feet . He covered face hands could see . They swarmed frenzied compulsion bludgeon , kick , gouge , trample . He pummeled spinning edge ditch sent slithering head shoulders . At bottom found footing , clambered wall staggered away beneath hail hoots stones pelted lurched shelter around corner orderly room tent . His paramount concern throughout entire assault keep dark glasses false mustache place might continue pretending somebody else spared dreaded necessity confront authority . Back office , wept ; finished weeping washed blood mouth nose , scrubbed dirt abrasions cheek forehead , summoned Sergeant Towser . “ From , ” said , “ I ’ want anyone come see I ’ . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said Sergeant Towser . “ Does include ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I see . Will ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What shall I say people come see ’ ? ” “ Tell I ’ ask wait. ” “ Yes , sir . For long ? ” “ Until I ’ left. ” “ And shall I ? ” “ I ’ care. ” “ May I send see ’ left ? ” “ Yes. ” “ But ’ , ? ” “ No. ” “ Yes , sir . Will ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ From , ” Major Major said middle-aged enlisted man took care trailer , “ I ’ want come I ’ ask ’ anything . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said orderly . “ When I come find ’ anything want ? ” “ When I ’ here. ” “ Yes , sir . And I ? ” “ Whatever I tell to. ” “ But ’ tell . Will ? ” “ No. ” “ Then I ? ” “ Whatever done. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ That , ” said Major Major . “ Yes , sir , ” said orderly . “ Will ? ” “ No , ” said Major Major . “ Don ’ come clean , either . Don ’ come anything unless ’ sure I ’ here. ” “ Yes , sir . But I always sure ? ” “ If ’ sure , assume I go away sure . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ I ’ sorry talk way , I . Goodbye. ” “ Goodbye , sir. ” “ And thank . For everything. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ From , ” Major Major said Milo Minderbinder , “ I ’ going come mess hall . I ’ meals brought trailer. ” “ I think ’ good idea , sir , ” Milo answered . “ Now I ’ able serve special dishes others never know . I ’ sure ’ enjoy . Colonel Cathcart always does. ” “ I ’ want special dishes . I want exactly serve officers . Just whoever brings knock door leave tray step . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said Milo . “ That ’ clear . I ’ got live Maine lobsters hidden away I serve tonight excellent Roquefort salad two frozen éclairs smuggled Paris yesterday together important member French underground . Will start ? ” “ No. ” “ Yes , sir . I understand. ” For dinner night Milo served broiled Maine lobster excellent Roquefort salad two frozen éclairs . Major Major annoyed . If sent back , though , would go waste somebody else , Major Major weakness broiled lobster . He ate guilty conscience . The next day lunch terrapin Maryland whole quart Dom Pérignon 1937 , Major Major gulped without thought . After Milo , remained men orderly room , Major Major avoided entering leaving every time dingy celluloid window office . The window unbuttoned low large easy jump either side . He managed distance orderly room trailer darting around corner tent coast clear , leaping railroad ditch dashing along head bowed attained sanctuary forest . Abreast trailer , left ditch wove way speedily toward home dense underbrush , person ever encountered Captain Flume , , drawn ghostly , frightened half death one twilight materializing without warning patch dewberry bushes complain Chief White Halfoat threatened slit throat open ear ear . “ If ever frighten like , ” Major Major told , “ I ’ slit throat open ear ear. ” Captain Flume gasped dissolved right back patch dewberry bushes , Major Major never set eyes . When Major Major looked back accomplished , pleased . In midst foreign acres teeming two hundred people , succeeded becoming recluse . With little ingenuity vision , made impossible anyone squadron talk , fine everyone , noticed , since one wanted talk anyway . No one , turned , madman Yossarian , brought flying tackle one day scooting along bottom ditch trailer lunch . The last person squadron Major Major wanted brought flying tackle Yossarian . There something inherently disreputable Yossarian , always carrying disgracefully dead man tent ’ even taking clothes Avignon mission going around without right day General Dreedle stepped pin medal heroism Ferrara found standing formation stark naked . No one world power remove dead man ’ disorganized effects Yossarian ’ tent . Major Major forfeited authority permitted Sergeant Towser report lieutenant killed Orvieto less two hours arrived squadron never arrived squadron . The one right remove belongings Yossarian ’ tent , seemed Major Major , Yossarian , Yossarian , seemed Major Major , right . Major Major groaned Yossarian brought flying tackle , tried wiggle feet . Yossarian ’ let . “ Captain Yossarian , ” Yossarian said , “ requests permission speak major matter life death. ” “ Let , please , ” Major Major bid cranky discomfort . “ I ’ return salute I ’ lying arm. ” Yossarian released . They stood slowly . Yossarian saluted repeated request . “ Let ’ go office , ” Major Major said . “ I ’ think best place talk. ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered Yossarian . They smacked gravel clothing walked constrained silence entrance orderly room . “ Give minute two put mercurochrome cuts . Then Sergeant Towser send in. ” “ Yes , sir. ” Major Major strode dignity rear orderly room without glancing clerks typists working desks filing cabinets . He let flap leading office fall closed behind . As soon alone office , raced across room window jumped outside dash away . He found Yossarian blocking path . Yossarian waiting attention saluted . “ Captain Yossarian requests permission speak major matter life death , ” repeated determinedly . “ Permission denied , ” Major Major snapped . “ That ’ it. ” Major Major gave . “ All right , ” conceded wearily . “ I ’ talk . Please jump inside office. ” “ After you. ” They jumped inside office . Major Major sat , Yossarian moved around front desk told want fly combat missions . What could ? Major Major asked . All could instructed Colonel Korn hope best . “ Why ? ” asked . “ I ’ afraid. ” “ That ’ nothing ashamed , ” Major Major counseled kindly . “ We ’ afraid. ” “ I ’ ashamed , ” Yossarian said . “ I ’ afraid. ” “ You ’ normal never afraid . Even bravest men experience fear . One biggest jobs face combat overcome fear. ” “ Oh , come , Major . Can ’ without horseshit ? ” Major Major lowered gaze sheepishly fiddled fingers . “ What want tell ? ” “ That I ’ flown enough missions go home. ” “ How many flown ? ” “ Fifty-one. ” “ You ’ got four fly. ” “ He ’ raise . Every time I get close raises them. ” “ Perhaps ’ time. ” “ He never sends anyone home , anyway . He keeps around waiting rotation orders ’ enough men left crews , raises number missions throws back combat status . He ’ ever since got here. ” “ You ’ blame Colonel Cathcart delay orders , ” Major Major advised . “ It ’ Twenty-seventh Air Force ’ responsibility process orders promptly get us. ” “ He could still ask replacements send us home orders come back . Anyway , I ’ told Twenty-seventh Air Force wants forty missions ’ idea get us fly fifty-five. ” “ I ’ know anything , ” Major Major answered . “ Colonel Cathcart commanding officer must obey . Why ’ fly four missions see happens ? ” “ I ’ want to. ” What could ? Major Major asked . What could man looked squarely eye said would rather die killed combat , man least mature intelligent pretend ? What could say ? “ Suppose let pick missions fly milk runs , ” Major Major said . “ That way fly four missions run risks. ” “ I ’ want fly milk runs . I ’ want war more. ” “ Would like see country lose ? ” Major Major asked . “ We ’ lose . We ’ got men , money material . There ten million men uniform could replace . Some people getting killed lot making money fun . Let somebody else get killed. ” “ But suppose everybody side felt way. ” “ Then I ’ certainly damned fool feel way . Wouldn ’ I ? ” What could possibly say ? Major Major wondered forlornly . One thing could say nothing could . To say nothing could would suggest would something could imply existence error injustice Colonel Korn ’ policy . Colonel Korn explicit . He must never say nothing could . “ I ’ sorry , ” said . “ But ’ nothing I do. ” 10 WINTERGREEN Clevinger dead . That basic flaw philosophy . Eighteen planes let beaming white cloud coast Elba one afternoon way back weekly milk run Parma ; seventeen came . No trace ever found , air smooth surface jade waters . There debris . Helicopters circled white cloud till sunset . During night cloud blew away , morning Clevinger . The disappearance astounding , astounding , certainly , Grand Conspiracy Lowery Field , sixty-four men single barrack vanished one payday never heard . Until Clevinger snatched existence adroitly , Yossarian assumed men simply decided unanimously go AWOL day . In fact , encouraged appeared mass desertion sacred responsibility gone running outside elation carry exciting news ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . “ What ’ exciting ? ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen sneered obnoxiously , resting filthy GI shoe spade lounging back surly slouch wall one deep , square holes military specialty dig . Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen snide little punk enjoyed working cross-purposes . Each time went AWOL , caught sentenced dig fill holes six feet deep , wide long specified length time . Each time finished sentence , went AWOL . Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen accepted role digging filling holes uncomplaining dedication true patriot . “ It ’ bad life , ” would observe philosophically . “ And I guess somebody it. ” He wisdom enough understand digging holes Colorado bad assignment wartime . Since holes great demand , could dig fill leisurely pace , seldom overworked . On hand , busted buck private time court-martialed . He regretted loss rank keenly . “ It kind nice P.F.C. , ” reminisced yearningly . “ I status-you know I mean ? – I used travel best circles. ” His face darkened resignation . “ But ’ behind , ” guessed . “ The next time I go hill buck private , I know ’ same. ” There future digging holes . “ The job ’ even steady . I lose time I finish serving sentence . Then I go hill I want back . And I ’ even keep . There ’ catch . Catch-22 . The next time I go hill , mean stockade . I ’ know ’ going become . I might even wind overseas I ’ careful. ” He want keep digging holes rest life , although objection long war going part war effort . “ It ’ matter duty , ” observed , “ perform . My duty keep digging holes , I ’ good job I ’ recommended Good Conduct Medal . Your duty screw around cadet school hope war ends get . The duty men combat win war , I wish duty well I ’ mine . It ’ fair I go overseas job , would ? ” One day ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen struck open water pipe digging one holes almost drowned death fished nearly unconscious . Word spread oil , Chief White Halfoat kicked base . Soon every man could find shovel outside digging frenziedly oil . Dirt flew everywhere ; scene almost like morning Pianosa seven months later night Milo bombed squadron every plane accumulated M amp ; M syndicate , airfield , bomb dump repair hangars well , survivors outside hacking cavernous shelters solid ground roofing sheets armor plate stolen repair sheds field tattered squares waterproof canvas stolen side flaps ’ tents . Chief White Halfoat transferred Colorado first rumor oil came rest finally Pianosa replacement Lieutenant Coombs , gone mission guest one day see combat like died Ferrara plane Kraft . Yossarian felt guilty time remembered Kraft , guilty Kraft killed Yossarian ’ second bomb run , guilty Kraft got mixed innocently also Splendid Atabrine Insurrection begun Puerto Rico first leg flight overseas ended Pianosa ten days later Appleby striding dutifully orderly room moment arrived report Yossarian refusing take Atabrine tablets . The sergeant invited seated . “ Thank , Sergeant , I think I , ” said Appleby . “ About long I wait ? I ’ still got lot get done today I fully prepared bright early tomorrow morning go combat minute want to. ” “ Sir ? ” “ What ’ , Sergeant ? ” “ What question ? ” “ About long I wait I go see major ? ” “ Just goes lunch , ” Sergeant Towser replied . “ Then go right in. ” “ But ’ . Will ? ” “ No , sir . Major Major ’ back office lunch. ” “ I see , ” Appleby decided uncertainly . “ I think I ’ better come back lunch , then. ” Appleby turned orderly room secret confusion . The moment stepped outside , thought saw tall , dark officer looked little like Henry Fonda come jumping window orderly-room tent go scooting sight around corner . Appleby halted squeezed eyes closed . An anxious doubt assailed . He wondered suffering malaria , , worse , overdose Atabrine tablets . Appleby taking four times many Atabrine tablets amount prescribed wanted four times good pilot everyone else . His eyes still shut Sergeant Towser tapped lightly shoulder told could go wanted , since Major Major gone . Appleby ’ confidence returned . “ Thank , Sergeant . Will back soon ? ” “ He ’ back right lunch . Then ’ go right wait front till leaves dinner . Major Major never sees anyone office ’ office. ” “ Sergeant , say ? ” “ I said Major Major never sees anyone office ’ office. ” Appleby stared Sergeant Towser intently attempted firm tone . “ Sergeant , trying make fool I ’ new squadron ’ overseas long time ? ” “ Oh , , sir , ” answered sergeant deferentially . “ Those orders . You ask Major Major see him. ” “ That ’ I intend , Sergeant . When I see ? ” “ Never. ” Crimson humiliation , Appleby wrote report Yossarian Atabrine tablets pad sergeant offered left quickly , wondering perhaps Yossarian man privileged wear officer ’ uniform crazy . By time Colonel Cathcart raised number missions fifty-five , Sergeant Towser begun suspect perhaps every man wore uniform crazy . Sergeant Towser lean angular fine blond hair light almost without color , sunken cheeks , teeth like large white marshmallows . He ran squadron happy . Men like Hungry Joe glowered blameful hatred , Appleby subjected vindictive discourtesy established hot pilot ping-pong player never lost point . Sergeant Towser ran squadron one else squadron run . He interest war advancement . He interested shards Hepplewhite furniture . Almost without realizing , Sergeant Towser fallen habit thinking dead man Yossarian ’ tent Yossarian ’ terms-as dead man Yossarian ’ tent . In reality , thing . He simply replacement pilot killed combat officially reported duty . He stopped operations tent inquire way orderly-room tent sent right action many men completed thirty-five missions required Captain Piltchard Captain Wren finding difficult assemble number crews specified Group . Because never officially gotten squadron , could never officially gotten , Sergeant Towser sensed multiplying communications relating poor man would continue reverberating forever . His name Mudd . To Sergeant Towser , deplored violence waste equal aversion , seemed like abhorrent extravagance fly Mudd way across ocean blown bits Orvieto less two hours arrived . No one could recall looked like , least Captain Piltchard Captain Wren , remembered new officer shown operations tent time killed colored uneasily every time matter dead man Yossarian ’ tent mentioned . The one might seen Mudd , men plane , blown bits . Yossarian , hand , knew exactly Mudd . Mudd unknown soldier never chance , thing anyone ever know unknown soldiers-they never chance . They dead . And dead one really unknown , even though belongings still lay tumble cot Yossarian ’ tent almost exactly left three months earlier day never arrived-all contaminated death less two hours later , way contaminated death next week Great Big Siege Bologna moldy odor mortality hung wet air sulphurous fog every man scheduled fly already tainted . There escaping mission Bologna Colonel Cathcart volunteered group ammunition dumps heavy bombers Italian mainland unable destroy higher altitudes . Each day ’ delay deepened awareness deepened gloom . The clinging , overpowering conviction death spread steadily continuing rainfall , soaking mordantly man ’ ailing countenance like corrosive blot crawling disease . Everyone smelled formaldehyde . There nowhere turn help , even medical tent , ordered closed Colonel Korn one could report sick call , men done one clear day mysterious epidemic diarrhea forced still another postponement . With sick call suspended door medical tent nailed shut , Doc Daneeka spent intervals rain perched high stool , wordlessly absorbing bleak outbreak fear sorrowing neutrality , roosting like melancholy buzzard ominous , hand-lettered sign tacked closed door medical tent Captain Black joke left hanging Doc Daneeka joke . The sign bordered dark crayon read : “ CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE . DEATH IN THE FAMILY. ” The fear flowed everywhere , Dunbar ’ squadron , Dunbar poked head inquiringly entrance medical tent one twilight spoke respectfully blurred outline Dr. Stubbs , sitting dense shadows inside bottle whiskey bell jar filled purified drinking water . “ Are right ? ” asked solicitously . “ Terrible , ” Dr. Stubbs answered . “ What ? ” “ Sitting. ” “ I thought sick call. ” “ There ’ t. ” “ Then sitting ? ” “ Where else I sit ? At goddam officers ’ club Colonel Cathcart Korn ? Do know I ’ ? ” “ Sitting. ” “ In squadron , I mean . Not tent . Don ’ goddam wise guy . Can figure doctor squadron ? ” “ They ’ got doors medical tents nailed shut squadrons , ” Dunbar remarked . “ If anyone sick walks door I ’ going ground , ” Dr. Stubbs vowed . “ I ’ give damn say. ” “ You ’ ground anyone , ” Dunbar reminded . “ Don ’ know orders ? ” “ I ’ knock flat ass injection really ground him. ” Dr. Stubbs laughed sardonic amusement prospect . “ They think order sick call existence . The bastards . Ooops , goes again. ” The rain began falling , first trees , mud puddles , , faintly , like soothing murmur , tent top . “ Everything ’ wet , ” Dr. Stubbs observed revulsion . “ Even latrines urinals backing protest . The whole goddam world smells like charnel house. ” The silence seemed bottomless stopped talking . Night fell . There sense vast isolation . “ Turn light , ” Dunbar suggested . “ There light . I ’ feel like starting generator . I used get big kick saving people ’ lives . Now I wonder hell ’ point , since die anyway . “ Oh , ’ point , right , ” Dunbar assured . “ Is ? What point ? ” “ The point keep dying long can. ” “ Yeah , ’ point , since die anyway ? ” “ The trick think that. ” “ Never mind trick . What hell ’ point ? ” Dunbar pondered silence moments . “ Who hell knows ? ” Dunbar ’ know . Bologna exulted Dunbar , minutes dawdled hours dragged like centuries . Instead tortured , knew going killed . “ Do really want codeine ? ” Dr. Stubbs asked . “ It ’ friend Yossarian . He ’ sure ’ going killed. ” “ Yossarian ? Who hell Yossarian ? What hell kind name Yossarian , anyway ? Isn ’ one got drunk started fight Colonel Korn officers ’ club night ? ” “ That ’ right . He ’ Assyrian. ” “ That crazy bastard. ” “ He ’ crazy , ” Dunbar said . “ He swears ’ going fly Bologna. ” “ That ’ I mean , ” Dr. Stubbs answered . “ That crazy bastard may sane one left. ” 11 CAPTAIN BLACK Corporal Kolodny learned first phone call Group shaken news crossed intelligence tent tiptoe Captain Black , resting drowsily bladed shins desk , relayed information shocked whisper . Captain Black brightened immediately . “ Bologna ? ” exclaimed delight . “ Well , I ’ damned. ” He broke loud laughter . “ Bologna , huh ? ” He laughed shook head pleasant amazement . “ Oh , boy ! I ’ wait see bastards ’ faces find ’ going Bologna . Ha , ha , ha ! ” It first really good laugh Captain Black enjoyed since day Major Major outsmarted appointed squadron commander , rose torpid enthusiasm stationed behind front counter order wring enjoyment occasion bombardiers arrived map kits . “ That ’ right , bastards , Bologna , ” kept repeating bombardiers inquired incredulously really going Bologna . “ Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Eat livers , bastards . This time ’ really it. ” Captain Black followed last outside observe relish effect knowledge upon officers enlisted men assembling helmets , parachutes flak suits around four trucks idling center squadron area . He tall , narrow , disconsolate man moved crabby listlessness . He shaved pinched , pale face every third fourth day , time appeared growing reddish-gold mustache skinny upper lip . He disappointed scene outside . There consternation darkening every expression , Captain Black yawned deliciously , rubbed last lethargy eyes laughed gloatingly time told someone else eat liver . Bologna turned rewarding event Captain Black ’ life since day Major Duluth killed Perugia almost selected replace . When word Major Duluth ’ death radioed back field , Captain Black responded surge joy . Although never really contemplated possibility , Captain Black understood logical man succeed Major Duluth squadron commander . To begin , squadron intelligence officer , meant intelligent everyone else squadron . True , combat status , Major Duluth squadron commanders customarily ; really another powerful argument favor , since life danger would able fill post long country needed . The Captain Black thought , inevitable seemed . It merely matter dropping right word right place quickly . He hurried back office determine course action . Settling back swivel chair , feet desk eyes closed , began imagining beautiful everything would squadron commander . While Captain Black imagining , Colonel Cathcart acting , Captain Black flabbergasted speed , concluded , Major Major outsmarted . His great dismay announcement Major Major ’ appointment squadron commander tinged embittered resentment made effort conceal . When fellow administrative officers expressed astonishment Colonel Cathcart ’ choice Major Major , Captain Black muttered something funny going ; speculated political value Major Major ’ resemblance Henry Fonda , Captain Black asserted Major Major really Henry Fonda ; remarked Major Major somewhat odd , Captain Black announced Communist . “ They ’ taking everything , ” declared rebelliously . “ Well , fellows stand around let want , I ’ going . I ’ going something . From I ’ going make every son bitch comes intelligence tent sign loyalty oath . And I ’ going let bastard Major Major sign one even wants to. ” Almost overnight Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade full flower , Captain Black enraptured discover spearheading . He really hit something . All enlisted men officers combat duty sign loyalty oath get map cases intelligence tent , second loyalty oath receive flak suits parachutes parachute tent , third loyalty oath Lieutenant Balkington , motor vehicle officer , allowed ride squadron airfield one trucks . Every time turned around another loyalty oath signed . They signed loyalty oath get pay finance officer , obtain PX supplies , hair cut Italian barbers . To Captain Black , every officer supported Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade competitor , planned plotted twenty-four hours day keep one step ahead . He would stand second none devotion country . When officers followed urging introduced loyalty oaths , went one better making every son bitch came intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths , three , four ; introduced pledge allegiance , “ The Star-Spangled Banner , ” one chorus , two choruses , three choruses , four choruses . Each time Captain Black forged ahead competitors , swung upon scornfully failure follow example . Each time followed example , retreated concern racked brain new stratagem would enable turn upon scornfully . Without realizing come , combat men squadron discovered dominated administrators appointed serve . They bullied , insulted , harassed shoved day long one . When voiced objection , Captain Black replied people loyal would mind signing loyalty oaths . To anyone questioned effectiveness loyalty oaths , replied people really owe allegiance country would proud pledge often forced . And anyone questioned morality , replied “ The Star-Spangled Banner ” greatest piece music ever composed . The loyalty oaths person signed , loyal ; Captain Black simple , Corporal Kolodny sign hundreds name day could always prove loyal anyone else . “ The important thing keep pledging , ” explained cohorts . “ It ’ matter whether mean . That ’ make little kids pledge allegiance even know ‘ pledge ’ ‘ allegiance ’ mean. ” To Captain Piltchard Captain Wren , Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade glorious pain ass , since complicated task organizing crews combat mission . Men tied squadron signing , pledging singing , missions took hours longer get way . Effective emergency action became impossible , Captain Piltchard Captain Wren timid raise outcry Captain Black , scrupulously enforced day doctrine “ Continual Reaffirmation ” originated , doctrine designed trap men become disloyal since last time signed loyalty oath day . It Captain Black came advice Captain Piltchard Captain Wren pitched bewildering predicament . He came delegation advised bluntly make man sign loyalty oath allowing fly combat mission . “ Of course , ’ , ” Captain Black pointed . “ Nobody ’ trying pressure . But everyone else making sign loyalty oaths , ’ going look mighty funny F.B.I . two ones ’ care enough country make sign loyalty oaths , . If want get bad reputation , ’ nobody ’ business . All ’ trying help. ” Milo convinced absolutely refused deprive Major Major food , even Major Major Communist , Milo secretly doubted . Milo nature opposed innovation threatened disrupt normal course affairs . Milo took firm moral stand absolutely refused participate Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade Captain Black called upon delegation requested . “ National defense everybody ’ job , ” Captain Black replied Milo ’ objection . “ And whole program voluntary , Milo-don ’ forget . The men ’ sign Piltchard Wren ’ loyalty oath ’ want . But need starve death ’ . It ’ like Catch-22 . Don ’ get ? You ’ Catch-22 , ? ” Doc Daneeka adamant . “ What makes sure Major Major Communist ? ” “ You never heard denying began accusing , ? And ’ see signing loyalty oaths. ” “ You ’ letting sign any. ” “ Of course , ” Captain Black explained . “ That would defeat whole purpose crusade . Look , ’ play ball us ’ want . But ’ point rest us working hard ’ going give Major Major medical attention minute Milo begins starving death ? I wonder ’ going think Group man ’ undermining whole security program . They ’ probably transfer Pacific. ” Doc Daneeka surrendered swiftly . “ I ’ go tell Gus Wes whatever want to. ” Up Group , Colonel Cathcart already begun wondering going . “ It ’ idiot Black patriotism binge , ” Colonel Korn reported smile . “ I think ’ better play ball , since ’ one promoted Major Major squadron commander. ” “ That idea , ” Colonel Cathcart accused Petulantly . “ I never let talk it. ” “ And good idea , , ” retorted Colonel Korn , “ since eliminated superfluous major ’ giving awful black eye administrator . Don ’ worry , probably run course soon . The best thing send Captain Black letter total support hope drops dead much damage. ” Colonel Korn struck whimsical thought . “ I wonder ! You ’ suppose imbecile try turn Major Major trailer , ? ” “ The next thing ’ got turn bastard Major Major trailer , ” Captain Black decided . “ I ’ like turn wife kids woods , . But ’ . He wife kids . So ’ make turn . Who ’ charge tents ? ” “ He is. ” “ You see ? ” cried Captain Black . “ They ’ taking everything ! Well , I ’ going stand . I ’ take matter right Major -- de Coverley I . I ’ Milo speak minute gets back Rome. ” Captain Black boundless faith wisdom , power justice Major -- de Coverley , even though never spoken still found without courage . He deputized Milo speak Major -- de Coverley stormed impatiently waited tall executive officer return . Along everyone else squadron , lived profound awe reverence majestic , white-haired major craggy face Jehovean bearing , came back Rome finally injured eye inside new celluloid eye patch smashed whole Glorious Crusade bits single stroke . Milo carefully said nothing Major -- de Coverley stepped mess hall fierce austere dignity day returned found way blocked wall officers waiting line sign loyalty oaths . At far end food counter , group men arrived earlier pledging allegiance flag , trays food balanced one hand , order allowed take seats table . Already tables , group arrived still earlier singing “ The Star-Spangled Banner ” order might use salt pepper ketchup . The hubbub began subside slowly Major -- de Coverley paused doorway frown puzzled disapproval , though viewing something bizarre . He started forward straight line , wall officers parted like Red Sea . Glancing neither left right , strode indomitably steam counter , clear , full-bodied voice gruff age resonant ancient eminence authority , said : “ Gim eat. ” Instead eat , Corporal Snark gave Major -- de Coverley loyalty oath sign . Major -- de Coverley swept away mighty displeasure moment recognized , good eye flaring blindingly fiery disdain enormous old corrugated face darkening mountainous wrath . “ Gim eat , I said , ” ordered loudly harsh tones rumbled ominously silent tent like claps distant thunder . Corporal Snark turned pale began tremble . He glanced toward Milo pleadingly guidance . For several terrible seconds sound . Then Milo nodded . “ Give eat , ” said . Corporal Snark began giving Major -- de Coverley eat . Major -- de Coverley turned counter tray full came stop . His eyes fell groups officers gazing mute appeal , , righteous belligerence , roared : “ Give everybody eat ! ” “ Give everybody eat ! ” Milo echoed joyful relief , Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade came end . Captain Black deeply disillusioned treacherous stab back someone high place upon relied confidently support . Major -- de Coverley let . “ Oh , ’ bother bit , ” responded cheerfully everyone came sympathy . “ We completed task . Our purpose make everyone ’ like afraid alert people danger Major Major , certainly succeeded . Since ’ going let sign loyalty oaths anyway , ’ really matter whether not. ” Seeing everyone squadron ’ like afraid throughout appalling , interminable Great Big Siege Bologna reminded Captain Black nostalgically good old days Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade man real consequence , even big shots like Milo Minderbinder , Doc Daneeka Piltchard Wren trembled approach groveled feet . To prove newcomers really man consequence , still letter commendation received Colonel Cathcart . 12 BOLOGNA Actually , Captain Black Sergeant Knight triggered solemn panic Bologna , slipping silently truck two extra flak suits soon learned target signaling start grim procession back parachute tent degenerated frantic stampede finally extra flak suits gone . “ Hey , ’ going ? ” Kid Sampson asked nervously . “ Bologna ’ rough , ? ” Nately , sitting trancelike floor truck , held grave young face hands answer . It Sergeant Knight cruel series postponements , climbing planes first morning , along came jeep news raining Bologna mission would delayed . It raining Pianosa time returned squadron , rest day stare woodenly bomb line map awning intelligence tent ruminate hypnotically fact escape . The evidence vividly narrow red ribbon tacked across mainland : ground forces Italy pinned forty-two insurmountable miles south target could possibly capture city time . Nothing could save men Pianosa mission Bologna . They trapped . Their hope would never stop raining , hope knew would . When stop raining Pianosa , rained Bologna . When stopped raining Bologna , began Pianosa . If rain , freakish , inexplicable phenomena like epidemic diarrhea bomb line moved . Four times first six days assembled briefed sent back . Once , took flying formation control tower summoned . The rained , worse suffered . The worse suffered , prayed would continue raining . All night , men looked sky saddened stars . All day , looked bomb line big , wobbling easel map Italy blew wind dragged awning intelligence tent every time rain began . The bomb line scarlet band narrow satin ribbon delineated forwardmost position Allied ground forces every sector Italian mainland . The morning Hungry Joe ’ fist fight Huple ’ cat , rain stopped falling places . The landing strip began dry . It would take full twenty-four hours harden ; sky remained cloudless . The resentments incubating man hatched hatred . First hated infantrymen mainland failed capture Bologna . Then began hate bomb line . For hours stared relentlessly scarlet ribbon map hated would move high enough encompass city . When night fell , congregated darkness flashlights , continuing macabre vigil bomb line brooding entreaty though hoping move ribbon collective weight sullen prayers . “ I really ’ believe , ” Clevinger exclaimed Yossarian voice rising falling protest wonder . “ It ’ complete reversion primitive superstition . They ’ confusing cause effect . It makes much sense knocking wood crossing fingers . They really believe ’ fly mission tomorrow someone would tiptoe map middle night move bomb line Bologna . Can imagine ? You I must rational ones left. ” In middle night Yossarian knocked wood , crossed fingers , tiptoed tent move bomb line Bologna . Corporal Kolodny tiptoed stealthily Captain Black ’ tent early next morning , reached inside mosquito net gently shook moist shoulder-blade found Captain Black opened eyes . “ What waking ? ” whimpered Captain Black . “ They captured Bologna , sir , ” said Corporal Kolodny . “ I thought ’ want know . Is mission canceled ? ” Captain Black tugged erect began scratching scrawny long thighs methodically . In little dressed emerged tent , squinting , cross unshaven . The sky clear warm . He peered without emotion map . Sure enough , captured Bologna . Inside intelligence tent , Corporal Kolodny already removing maps Bologna navigation kits . Captain Black seated loud yawn , lifted feet top desk phoned Colonel Korn . “ What waking ? ” whimpered Colonel Korn . “ They captured Bologna night , sir . Is mission canceled ? ” “ What talking , Black ? ” Colonel Korn growled . “ Why mission canceled ? ” “ Because captured Bologna , sir . Isn ’ mission canceled ? ” “ Of course mission canceled .

I hate say , Yossarian , ’ turning chronic complainer. ” Clevinger agreed ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen Yossarian ’ job get killed Bologna livid condemnation Yossarian confessed moved bomb line caused mission canceled . “ Why hell ? ” Yossarian snarled , arguing vehemently suspected wrong . “ Am I supposed get ass shot colonel wants general ? ” “ What men mainland ? ” Clevinger demanded much emotion . “ Are supposed get asses shot ’ want go ? Those men entitled air support ! ” “ But necessarily . Look , ’ care knocks ammunition dumps . The reason ’ going bastard Cathcart volunteered us. ” “ Oh , I know , ” Clevinger assured , gaunt face pale agitated brown eyes swimming sincerity . “ But fact remains ammunition dumps still standing .

And ’ forget , longer remember , longer might live. ” But Clevinger forget , dead . At time , Clevinger upset incident Yossarian dare tell also responsible epidemic diarrhea caused unnecessary postponement . Milo even upset possibility someone poisoned squadron , came bustling fretfully Yossarian assistance . “ Please find Corporal Snark put laundry soap sweet potatoes , ” requested furtively . “ Corporal Snark trusts tell truth give word ’ tell anyone else .

Laundry soap best way. ” “ He swears God ’ thing , ” Yossarian reported back Milo . Milo pouted dubiously . “ Dunbar says God. ” There hope left . By middle second week , everyone squadron began look like Hungry Joe , scheduled fly screamed horribly sleep . He one could sleep . All night long , men moved darkness outside tents like tongueless wraiths cigarettes . In daytime stared bomb line futile , drooping clusters still figure Doc Daneeka sitting front closed door medical tent beneath morbid hand-lettered sign . They began invent humorless , glum jokes disastrous rumors destruction awaiting Bologna . Yossarian sidled drunkenly Colonel Korn officers ’ club one night kid new Lepage gun Germans moved . “ What Lepage gun ? ” Colonel Korn inquired curiosity . “ The new three-hundred-and-forty-four-millimeter Lepage glue gun , ” Yossarian answered . “ It glues whole formation planes together mid-air. ” Colonel Korn jerked elbow free Yossarian ’ clutching fingers startled affront . “ Let go , idiot ! ” cried furiously , glaring vindictive approval Nately leaped upon Yossarian ’ back pulled away . “ Who lunatic , anyway ? ” Colonel Cathcart chortled merrily . “ That ’ man made give medal Ferrara .

It ’ much better headlights off. ” “ Are crazy ? ” Clevinger screamed , lunged forward snap headlights . He whirled around upon Yossarian near hysteria . “ You see ’ ? You ’ got acting like ! Suppose stops raining fly Bologna tomorrow . You ’ fine physical condition. ” “ It ’ ever gon na stop raining . No , sir , rain like really might go forever. ” “ It stopped raining ! ” someone said , whole car fell silent . “ You poor bastards , ” Chief White Halfoat murmured compassionately moments passed . “ Did really stop raining ? ” Yossarian asked meekly . McWatt switched windshield wipers make certain . The rain stopped . The sky starting clear .

His agony terrifying , piercing , unearthly howl split moonlit dark vibrating impact seconds afterward like devastating shock . A numbing silence followed , riotous din rose inside tent . Yossarian among first ones . When burst entrance , Hungry Joe gun struggling wrench arm free Huple shoot cat , kept spitting feinting ferociously distract shooting Huple . Both humans GI underwear .

He swaggered away happily proud smile champion , shriveled head high emaciated chest . He went back bed victorious dreamed Huple ’ cat sleeping face , suffocating . 13 MAJOR -- DE COVERLEY Moving bomb line fool Germans , fool Major -- de Coverley , packed musette bag , commandeered airplane , impression Florence captured Allies , flown city rent two apartments officers enlisted men squadron use rest leaves .

A day two city fell , would back leases two large luxurious apartments , one officers one enlisted men , already staffed competent , jolly cooks maids . A days , newspapers would appear throughout world photographs first American soldiers bludgeoning way shattered city rubble smoke . Inevitably , Major -- de Coverley among , seated straight ramrod jeep obtained somewhere , glancing neither right left artillery fire burst invincible head lithe young infantrymen carbines went loping along sidewalks shelter burning buildings fell dead doorways . He seemed eternally indestructible sat surrounded danger , features molded firmly fierce , regal , forbidding countenance recognized revered every man squadron . To German intelligence , Major -- de Coverley vexatious enigma ; one hundreds American prisoners would ever supply concrete information elderly white-haired officer gnarled menacing brow blazing , powerful eyes seemed spearhead every important advance fearlessly successfully . To American authorities identity equally perplexing ; whole regiment crack C.I.D . men thrown front lines find , battalion combat-hardened public-relations officers stood red alert twenty-four hours day orders begin publicizing moment located . In Rome , Major -- de Coverley outdone apartments . For officers , arrived groups four five , immense double room new white stone building , three spacious bathrooms walls shimmering aquamarine tile one skinny maid named Michaela tittered everything kept apartment spotless order . On landing lived obsequious owners . On landing lived beautiful rich black-haired Countess beautiful , rich black-haired daughter-in-law , would put Nately , shy want , Aarfy , stuffy take tried dissuade ever putting anyone husbands , chosen remain north family ’ business interests . “ They ’ really couple good kids , ” Aarfy confided earnestly Yossarian , whose recurring dream nude milk-white female bodies beautiful rich black-haired good kids lying stretched bed erotically time .

The girls shelter food long wanted stay . All return hump men asked , seemed make everything perfect . Every fourth day Hungry Joe came crashing like man torment , hoarse , wild , frenetic , unlucky enough finish missions flying courier ship . Most times slept enlisted men ’ apartment . Nobody certain many rooms Major -- de Coverley rented , even stout black-bodiced woman corsets first floor rented . They covered whole top floor , Yossarian knew extended fifth floor well , Snowden ’ room fifth floor finally found maid lime-colored panties dust mop day Bologna , Hungry Joe discovered bed Luciana officers ’ apartment morning gone running like fiend camera .

Her allure stemmed accessibility ; like Mt . Everest , , men climbed top time felt urge . Yossarian love maid lime-colored panties seemed woman left could make love without falling love . Even bald-headed girl Sicily still evoked strong sensations pity , tenderness regret . Despite multiple perils Major -- de Coverley exposed time rented apartments , injury occurred , ironically enough , leading triumphal procession open city Rome , wounded eye flower fired close range seedy , cackling , intoxicated old man , , like Satan , bounded Major -- de Coverley ’ car malicious glee , seized roughly contemptuously venerable white head kissed mockingly cheek mouth reeking sour fumes wine , cheese garlic , dropping back joyous celebrating throngs hollow , dry , excoriating laugh . Major -- de Coverley , Spartan adversity , flinch throughout whole hideous ordeal . And returned Pianosa , business Rome completed , seek medical attention wound . He resolved remain binocular specified Doc Daneeka eye patch transparent could continue pitching horseshoes , kidnaping Italian laborers renting apartments unimpaired vision . To men squadron , Major -- de Coverley colossus , although never dared tell . The one ever dare address Milo Minderbinder , approached horseshoe-pitching pit hard-boiled egg second week squadron held aloft Major -- de Coverley see . Major -- de Coverley straightened astonishment Milo ’ effrontery concentrated upon full fury storming countenance rugged overhang gullied forehead huge crag humpbacked nose came charging face wrathfully like Big Ten fullback . Milo stood ground , taking shelter behind hard-boiled egg raised protectively face like magic charm . In time gale began subside , danger passed . “ What ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded last . “ An egg , ” Milo answered “ What kind egg ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ A hard-boiled egg , ” Milo answered . “ What kind hard-boiled egg ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ A fresh hard-boiled egg , ” Milo answered . “ Where fresh egg come ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ From chicken , ” Milo answered . “ Where chicken ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ The chicken Malta , ” Milo answered . “ How many chickens Malta ? ” “ Enough chickens lay fresh eggs every officer squadron five cents apiece mess fund , ” Milo answered . “ I weakness fresh eggs , ” Major -- de Coverley confessed . “ If someone put plane disposal , I could fly week squadron plane bring back fresh eggs need , ” Milo answered . “ After , Malta ’ far away. ” “ Malta ’ far away , ” Major -- de Coverley observed . “ You could probably fly week squadron plane bring back fresh eggs need. ” “ Yes , ” Milo agreed . “ I suppose I could , someone wanted put plane disposal. ” “ I like fresh eggs fried , ” Major -- de Coverley remembered . “ In fresh butter. ” “ I find fresh butter need Sicily twenty-five cents pound , ” Milo answered . “ Twenty-five cents pound fresh butter good buy . There ’ enough money mess fund butter , could probably sell squadrons profit get back pay own. ” “ What ’ name , son ? ” asked Major -- de Coverley . “ My name Milo Minderbinder , sir .

How much horseshoes selling ? ” The smell fresh egg snapping exotically pool fresh butter carried long way Mediterranean trade winds brought General Dreedle racing back voracious appetite , accompanied nurse , accompanied everywhere , son-in-law , Colonel Moodus . In beginning General Dreedle devoured meals Milo ’ mess hall . Then three squadrons Colonel Cathcart ’ group turned mess halls Milo gave airplane pilot could buy fresh eggs fresh butter . Milo ’ planes shuttled back forth seven days week every officer four squadrons began devouring fresh eggs insatiable orgy fresh-egg eating . General Dreedle devoured fresh eggs breakfast , lunch dinner-between meals devoured fresh eggs-until Milo located abundant sources fresh veal , beef , duck , baby lamb chops , mushroom caps , broccoli , South African rock lobster tails , shrimp , hams , puddings , grapes , ice cream , strawberries artichokes . There three bomb groups General Dreedle ’ combat wing , jealously dispatched planes Malta fresh eggs , discovered fresh eggs selling seven cents apiece . Since could buy Milo five cents apiece , made sense turn mess halls syndicate , , give planes pilots needed ferry good food promised supply well . Everyone elated turn events , Colonel Cathcart , convinced feather cap . He greeted Milo jovially time met , excess contrite generosity , impulsively recommended Major Major promotion . The recommendation rejected Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , scribbled brusque , unsigned reminder Army one Major Major Major Major intend lose promotion please Colonel Cathcart . Colonel Cathcart stung blunt rebuke skulked guiltily room smarting repudiation . He blamed Major Major black eye decided bust lieutenant day . “ They probably ’ let , ” Colonel Korn remarked condescending smile , savoring situation . “ For precisely reasons ’ let promote . Besides , ’ certainly look foolish trying bust lieutenant right tried promote rank. ” Colonel Cathcart felt hemmed every side . He much successful obtaining medal Yossarian debacle Ferrara , bridge spanning Po still standing undamaged seven days Colonel Cathcart volunteered destroy . Nine missions men flown six days , bridge demolished tenth mission seventh day , Yossarian killed Kraft crew taking flight six planes target second time . Yossarian came carefully second bomb run brave . He buried head bombsight bombs away ; looked , everything inside ship suffused weird orange glow . At first thought plane fire . Then spied plane burning engine directly screamed McWatt intercom turn left hard . A second later , wing Kraft ’ plane blew . The flaming wreck dropped , first fuselage , spinning wing , shower tiny metal fragments began tap dancing roof Yossarian ’ plane incessant cachung ! cachung ! cachung ! flak still thumping around . Back ground , every eye watched grimly walked dull dejection Captain Black outside green clapboard briefing room make intelligence report learned Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn waiting speak inside . Major Danby stood barring door , waving everyone else away ashen silence . Yossarian leaden fatigue longed remove sticky clothing . He stepped briefing room mixed emotions , uncertain supposed feel Kraft others , died distance mute secluded agony moment ass vile , excruciating dilemma duty damnation . Colonel Cathcart , hand , broken event . “ Twice ? ” asked . “ I would missed first time , ” Yossarian replied softly , face lowered . Their voices echoed slightly long , narrow bungalow . “ But twice ? ” Colonel Cathcart repeated , vivid disbelief . “ I would missed first time , ” Yossarian repeated . “ But Kraft would alive. ” “ And bridge would still up. ” “ A trained bombardier supposed drop bombs first time , ” Colonel Cathcart reminded . “ The five bombardiers dropped bombs first time. ” “ And missed target , ” Yossarian said . “ We ’ go back again. ” “ And maybe would gotten first time then. ” “ And maybe I ’ gotten all. ” “ But maybe ’ losses. ” “ And maybe would losses , bridge still left standing . I thought wanted bridge destroyed. ” “ Don ’ contradict , ” Colonel Cathcart said . “ We ’ enough trouble. ” “ I ’ contradicting , sir. ” “ Yes . Even ’ contradiction. ” “ Yes , sir . I ’ sorry. ” Colonel Cathcart cracked knuckles violently . Colonel Korn , stocky , dark , flaccid man shapeless paunch , sat completely relaxed one benches front row , hands clasped comfortably top bald swarthy head . His eyes amused behind glinting rimless spectacles . “ We ’ trying perfectly objective , ” prompted Colonel Cathcart . “ We ’ trying perfectly objective , ” Colonel Cathcart said Yossarian zeal sudden inspiration . “ It ’ I ’ sentimental anything . I ’ give damn men airplane . It ’ looks lousy report . How I going cover something like report ? ” “ Why ’ give medal ? ” Yossarian suggested timidly . “ For going around twice ? ” “ You gave one Hungry Joe cracked airplane mistake. ” Colonel Cathcart snickered ruefully . “ You ’ lucky ’ give court-martial. ” “ But I got bridge second time around , ” Yossarian protested . “ I thought wanted bridge destroyed. ” “ Oh , I ’ know I wanted , ” Colonel Cathcart cried exasperation . “ Look , course I wanted bridge destroyed . That bridge source trouble ever since I decided send men get . But ’ first time ? ” “ I ’ enough time . My navigator ’ sure right city. ” “ The right city ? ” Colonel Cathcart baffled . “ Are trying blame Aarfy ? ” “ No , sir . It mistake letting distract . All I ’ trying say I ’ infallible. ” “ Nobody infallible , ” Colonel Cathcart said sharply , continued vaguely , afterthought : “ Nobody indispensable , either. ” There rebuttal . Colonel Korn stretched sluggishly . “ We ’ got reach decision , ” observed casually Colonel Cathcart . “ We ’ got reach decision , ” Colonel Cathcart said Yossarian . “ And ’ fault . Why go around twice ? Why ’ drop bombs first time like others ? ” “ I would missed first time. ” “ It seems ’ going around twice , ” Colonel Korn interrupted chuckle . “ But going ? ” Colonel Cathcart exclaimed distress . “ The others waiting outside. ” “ Why ’ give medal ? ” Colonel Korn proposed . “ For going around twice ? What give medal ? ” “ For going around twice , ” Colonel Korn answered reflective , self-satisfied smile . “ After , I suppose take lot courage go target second time planes around divert antiaircraft fire . And hit bridge . You know , might answer-to act boastfully something ought ashamed . That ’ trick never seems fail. ” “ Do think work ? ” “ I ’ sure . And let ’ promote captain , , make certain. ” “ Don ’ think ’ going bit farther ? ” “ No , I ’ think . It ’ best play safe . And captain ’ much difference. ” “ All right , ” Colonel Cathcart decided . “ We ’ give medal brave enough go around target twice . And ’ make captain , too. ” Colonel Korn reached hat . “ Exit smiling , ” joked , put arm around Yossarian ’ shoulders stepped outside door . 14 KID SAMPSON By time mission Bologna , Yossarian brave enough go around target even , found aloft finally nose Kid Sampson ’ plane , pressed button throat mike asked , “ Well ? What ’ wrong plane ? ” Kid Sampson let shriek . “ Is something wrong plane ? What ’ matter ? ” Kid Sampson ’ cry turned Yossarian ice . “ Is something matter ? ” yelled horror . “ Are bailing ? ” “ I ’ know ! ” Kid Sampson shot back anguish , wailing excitedly . “ Someone said ’ bailing ! Who , anyway ? Who ? ” “ This Yossarian nose ! Yossarian nose . I heard say something matter . Didn ’ say something matter ? ” “ I thought said something wrong . Everything seems okay . Everything right. ” Yossarian ’ heart sank . Something terribly wrong everything right excuse turning back . He hesitated gravely . “ I ’ hear , ” said . “ I said everything right. ” The sun blinding white porcelain-blue water flashing edges airplanes . Yossarian took hold colored wires leading jackbox intercom system tore loose . “ I still ’ hear , ” said . He heard nothing . Slowly collected map case three flak suits crawled back main compartment . Nately , sitting stiffly co-pilot ’ seat , spied corner eye stepped flight deck behind Kid Sampson . He smiled Yossarian wanly , looking frail exceptionally young bashful bulky dungeon earphones , hat , throat mike , flak suit parachute . Yossarian bent close Kid Sampson ’ ear . “ I still ’ hear , ” shouted even drone engines . Kid Sampson glanced back surprise . Kid Sampson angular , comical face arched eyebrows scrawny blond mustache . “ What ? ” called shoulder . “ I still ’ hear , ” Yossarian repeated . “ You ’ talk louder , ” Kid Sampson said . “ I still ’ hear you. ” “ I said I still ’ hear ! ” Yossarian yelled . “ I ’ help , ” Kid Sampson yelled back . “ I ’ shouting loud I can. ” “ I ’ hear intercom , ” Yossarian bellowed mounting helplessness . “ You ’ turn back. ” “ For intercom ? ” asked Kid Sampson incredulously . “ Turn back , ” said Yossarian , “ I break head. ” Kid Sampson looked moral support toward Nately , stared away pointedly . Yossarian outranked . Kid Sampson resisted doubtfully another moment capitulated eagerly triumphant whoop . “ That ’ fine , ” announced gladly , blew shrill series whistles mustache . “ Yes sirree , ’ fine old Kid Sampson. ” He whistled shouted intercom , “ Now hear , little chickadees . This Admiral Kid Sampson talking . This Admiral Kid Sampson squawking , pride Queen ’ marines . Yessiree . We ’ turning back , boys , crackee , ’ turning back ! ” Nately ripped hat earphones one jubilant sweep began rocking back forth happily like handsome child high chair . Sergeant Knight came plummeting top gun turret began pounding back delirious enthusiasm . Kid Sampson turned plane away formation wide , graceful arc headed toward airfield . When Yossarian plugged headset one auxiliary jackboxes , two gunners rear section plane singing “ La Cucaracha. ” Back field , party fizzled abruptly . An uneasy silence replaced , Yossarian sober self-conscious climbed plane took place jeep already waiting . None men spoke drive back heavy , mesmerizing quiet blanketing mountains , sea forests . The feeling desolation persisted turned road squadron . Yossarian got car last . After minute , Yossarian gentle warm wind things stirring haunting tranquillity hung like drug vacated tents . The squadron stood insensate , bereft everything human Doc Daneeka , roosted dolorously like shivering turkey buzzard beside closed door medical tent , stuffed nose jabbing away thirsting futility hazy sunlight streaming around . Yossarian knew Doc Daneeka would go swimming . Doc Daneeka would never go swimming ; person could swoon suffer mild coronary occlusion inch two water drown death , carried sea undertow , made vulnerable poliomyelitis meningococcus infection chilling over-exertion . The threat Bologna others instilled Doc Daneeka even poignant solicitude safety . At night , heard burglars . Through lavender gloom clouding entrance operations tent , Yossarian glimpsed Chief White Halfoat , diligently embezzling whiskey rations , forging signatures nondrinkers pouring alcohol poisoning separate bottles rapidly order steal much could Captain Black roused recollection came hurrying indolently steal rest . The jeep started softly . Kid Sampson , Nately others wandered apart noiseless eddy motion sucked away cloying yellow stillness . The jeep vanished cough . Yossarian alone ponderous , primeval lull everything green looked black everything else imbued color pus . The breeze rustled leaves dry diaphanous distance . He restless , scared sleepy . The sockets eyes felt grimy exhaustion . Wearily moved inside parachute tent long table smoothed wood , nagging bitch doubt burrowing painlessly inside conscience felt perfectly clear . He left flak suit parachute crossed back past water wagon intelligence tent return map case Captain Black , sat drowsing chair skinny long legs desk inquired indifferent curiosity Yossarian ’ plane turned back . Yossarian ignored . He set map counter walked . Back tent , squirmed parachute harness clothes . Orr Rome , due back afternoon rest leave ditching plane waters Genoa . Nately would already packing replace , entranced find still alive undoubtedly impatient resume wasted heartbreaking courtship prostitute Rome . When Yossarian undressed , sat cot rest . He felt much better soon naked . He never felt comfortable clothes . In little put fresh undershorts back set beach moccasins , khaki-colored bath towel draped shoulders . The path squadron led around mysterious gun emplacement woods ; two three enlisted men stationed lay sleeping circle sand bags third sat eating purple pomegranate , biting large mouthfuls churning jaws spewing ground roughage away bushes . When bit , red juice ran mouth . Yossarian padded ahead forest , caressing bare , tingling belly adoringly time time though reassure still . He rolled piece lint navel . Along ground suddenly , sides path , saw dozens new mushrooms rain spawned poking nodular fingers clammy earth like lifeless stalks flesh , sprouting necrotic profusion everywhere looked seemed proliferating right eyes . There thousands swarming far back underbrush could see , appeared swell size multiply number spied . He hurried away shiver eerie alarm slacken pace soil crumbled dry sand beneath feet left behind . He glanced back apprehensively , half expecting find limp white things crawling sightless pursuit snaking treetops writhing ungovernable mutative mass . The beach deserted . The sounds hushed ones , bloated gurgle stream , respirating hum tall grass shrubs behind , apathetic moaning dumb , translucent waves . The surf always small , water clear cool . Yossarian left things sand moved knee-high waves completely immersed . On side sea , bumpy sliver dark land lay wrapped mist , almost invisible . He swam languorously raft , held moment , swam languorously back could stand sand bar . He submerged head first green water several times felt clean wide-awake stretched face sand slept planes returning Bologna almost overhead great , cumulative rumble many engines came crashing slumber earth-shattering roar . He woke blinking slight pain head opened eyes upon world boiling chaos everything proper order . He gasped utter amazement fantastic sight twelve flights planes organized calmly exact formation . The scene unexpected true . There planes spurting ahead wounded , none lagging behind damage . No distress flares smoked sky . No ship missing . For instant paralyzed sensation madness . Then understood , almost wept irony . The explanation simple : clouds covered target planes could bomb , mission Bologna still flown . He wrong . There clouds . Bologna bombed . Bologna milk run . There flak . 15 PILTCHARD amp ; WREN Captain Piltchard Captain Wren , inoffensive joint squadron operations officers , mild , soft-spoken men less middle height enjoyed flying combat missions begged nothing life Colonel Cathcart opportunity continue flying . They flown hundreds combat missions wanted fly hundreds . They assigned every one . Nothing wonderful war ever happened ; afraid might never happen . They conducted duties humbly reticently , minimum fuss , went great lengths antagonize anyone . They smiled quickly everyone passed . When spoke , mumbled . They shifty , cheerful , subservient men comfortable never met anyone else ’ eye , even Yossarian ’ eye open-air meeting called reprimand publicly making Kid Sampson turn back mission Bologna . “ Fellas , ” said Captain Piltchard , thinning dark hair smiled awkwardly . “ When turn back mission , try make sure ’ something important , ? Not something unimportant… like defective intercom… something like . Okay ? Captain Wren wants say subject. ” “ Captain Piltchard ’ right , fellas , ” said Captain Wren . “ And ’ I ’ going say subject . Well , finally got Bologna today , found ’ milk run . We little nervous , I guess , ’ much damage . Well , listen . Colonel Cathcart got permission us go back . And tomorrow ’ really going paste ammunition dumps . Now , think ? ” And prove Yossarian bore animosity , even assigned fly lead bombardier McWatt first formation went back Bologna next day . He came target like Havermeyer , confidently taking evasive action , suddenly shooting living shit ! Heavy flak everywhere ! He lulled , lured trapped , nothing could sit like idiot watch ugly black puffs smashing kill . There nothing could bombs dropped look back bombsight , fine cross-hairs lens glued magnetically target exactly placed , intersecting perfectly deep inside yard block camouflaged warehouses base first building . He trembling steadily plane crept ahead . He could hear hollow boom-boom-boom-boom flak pounding around overlapping measures four , sharp , piercing crack ! single shell exploding suddenly close . His head bursting thousand dissonant impulses prayed bombs drop . He wanted sob . The engines droned monotonously like fat , lazy fly . At last indices bombsight crossed , tripping away eight 500-pounders one . The plane lurched upward buoyantly lightened load . Yossarian bent away bombsight crookedly watch indicator left . When pointer touched zero , closed bomb bay doors , intercom , top voice , shrieked : “ Turn right hard ! ” McWatt responded instantly . With grinding howl engines , flipped plane one wing wrung around remorselessly screaming turn away twin spires flak Yossarian spied stabbing toward . Then Yossarian McWatt climb keep climbing higher higher tore free finally calm , diamond-blue sky sunny pure everywhere laced distance long white veils tenuous fluff . The wind strummed soothingly cylindrical panes windows , relaxed exultantly picked speed turned McWatt left plunged right back , noticing transitory spasm elation mushrooming clusters flak leaping open high back shoulder right , exactly could turned left dived . He leveled McWatt another harsh cry whipped upward around ragged blue patch unpolluted air bombs dropped began strike . The first one fell yard , exactly aimed , rest bombs plane planes flight burst open ground charge rapid orange flashes across tops buildings , collapsed instantly vast , churning wave pink gray coal-black smoke went rolling turbulently directions quaked convulsively bowels though great blasts red white golden sheet lightning . “ Well , look , ” Aarfy marveled sonorously right beside Yossarian , plump , orbicular face sparkling look bright enchantment . “ There must ammunition dump there. ” Yossarian forgotten Aarfy . “ Get ! ” shouted . “ Get nose ! ” Aarfy smiled politely pointed toward target generous invitation Yossarian look . Yossarian began slapping insistently signaled wildly toward entrance crawlway . “ Get back ship ! ” cried frantically . “ Get back ship ! ” Aarfy shrugged amiably . “ I ’ hear , ” explained . Yossarian seized straps parachute harness pushed backward toward crawlway plane hit jarring concussion rattled bones made heart stop . He knew dead . “ Climb ! ” screamed intercom McWatt saw still alive . “ Climb , bastard ! Climb , climb , climb , climb ! ” The plane zoomed upward climb swift straining , leveled another harsh shout McWatt wrenched around roaring , merciless forty-five-degree turn sucked insides one enervating sniff left floating fleshless mid-air leveled McWatt long enough hurl back around toward right screeching dive . Through endless blobs ghostly black smoke sped , hanging smut wafting smooth plexiglass nose ship like evil , damp , sooty vapor cheeks . His heart hammering aching terror hurtled upward downward blind gangs flak charging murderously sky , sagging inertly . Sweat gushed neck torrents poured chest waist feeling warm slime . He vaguely aware instant planes formation longer , aware . His throat hurt like raw slash strangling intensity shrieked command McWatt . The engines rose deafening , agonized , ululating bellow time McWatt changed direction . And far front bursts flak still swarming sky new batteries guns poking around accurate altitude waited sadistically fly range . The plane slammed suddenly another loud , jarring explosion almost rocked back , nose filled immediately sweet clouds blue smoke . Something fire ! Yossarian whirled escape smacked Aarfy , struck match placidly lighting pipe . Yossarian gaped grinning , moon-faced navigator utter shock confusion . It occurred one mad . “ Jesus Christ ! ” screamed Aarfy tortured amazement . “ Get hell nose ! Are crazy ? Get ! ” “ What ? ” said Aarfy . “ Get ! ” Yossarian yelled hysterically , began clubbing Aarfy backhanded fists drive away . “ Get ! ” “ I still ’ hear , ” Aarfy called back innocently expression mild reproving perplexity . “ You ’ talk little louder. ” “ Get nose ! ” Yossarian shrieked frustration . “ They ’ trying kill us ! Don ’ understand ? They ’ trying kill us ! ” “ Which way I go , goddam ? ” McWatt shouted furiously intercom suffering , high-pitched voice . “ Which way I go ? ” “ Turn left ! Left , goddam dirty son bitch ! Turn left hard ! ” Aarfy crept close behind Yossarian jabbed sharply ribs stem pipe . Yossarian flew toward ceiling whinnying cry , jumped completely around knees , white sheet quivering rage . Aarfy winked encouragingly jerked thumb back toward McWatt humorous moue . “ What ’ eating ? ” asked laugh . Yossarian struck weird sense distortion . “ Will get ? ” yelped beseechingly , shoved Aarfy strength . “ Are deaf something ? Get back plane ! ” And McWatt screamed , “ Dive ! Dive ! ” Down sank crunching , thudding , voluminous barrage bursting antiaircraft shells Aarfy came creeping back behind Yossarian jabbed sharply ribs . Yossarian shied upward another whinnying gasp . “ I still ’ hear , ” Aarfy said . “ I said get ! ” Yossarian shouted , broke tears . He began punching Aarfy body hands hard could . “ Get away ! Get away ! ” Punching Aarfy like sinking fists limp sack inflated rubber . There resistance , response soft , insensitive mass , Yossarian ’ spirit died arms dropped helplessly exhaustion . He overcome humiliating feeling impotence ready weep self-pity . “ What say ? ” Aarfy asked . “ Get away , ” Yossarian answered , pleading . “ Go back plane. ” “ I still ’ hear you. ” “ Never mind , ” wailed Yossarian , “ never mind . Just leave alone. ” “ Never mind ? ” Yossarian began hitting forehead . He seized Aarfy shirt front , struggling feet traction , dragged rear nose compartment flung like bloated unwieldy bag entrance crawlway . A shell banged open stupendous clout right beside ear scrambling back toward front , undestroyed recess intelligence wondered kill . They climbing . The engines howling though pain , air inside plane acrid smell machinery fetid stench gasoline . The next thing knew , snowing ! Thousands tiny bits white paper falling like snowflakes inside plane , milling around head thickly clung eyelashes blinked astonishment fluttered nostrils lips time inhaled . When spun around bewilderment , Aarfy grinning proudly ear ear like something inhuman held shattered paper map Yossarian see . A large chunk flak ripped floor Aarfy ’ colossal jumble maps ripped ceiling inches away heads . Aarfy ’ joy sublime . “ Will look ? ” murmured , waggling two stubby fingers playfully Yossarian ’ face hole one maps . “ Will look ? ” Yossarian dumbfounded state rapturous contentment . Aarfy like eerie ogre dream , incapable bruised evaded , Yossarian dreaded complex reasons petrified untangle . Wind whistling jagged gash floor kept myriad bits paper circulating like alabaster particles paperweight contributed sensation lacquered , waterlogged unreality . Everything seemed strange , tawdry grotesque . His head throbbing shrill clamor drilled relentlessly ears . It McWatt , begging directions incoherent frenzy . Yossarian continued staring tormented fascination Aarfy ’ spherical countenance beaming serenely vacantly drifting whorls white paper bits concluded raving lunatic eight bursts flak broke open successively eye level right , eight , eight , last group pulled toward left almost directly front . “ Turn left hard ! ” hollered McWatt , Aarfy kept grinning , McWatt turn left hard , flak turned left hard , catching fast , Yossarian hollered , “ I said hard , hard , hard , hard , bastard , hard ! ” And McWatt bent plane around even harder still , suddenly , miraculously , range . The flak ended . The guns stopped booming . And alive . Behind , men dying . Strung miles stricken , tortuous , squirming line , flights planes making hazardous journey target , threading swift way swollen masses new old bursts flak like rats racing pack droppings . One fire , flapped lamely , billowing gigantically like monstrous blood-red star . As Yossarian watched , burning plane floated side began spiraling slowly wide , tremulous , narrowing circles , huge flaming burden blazing orange flaring back like long , swirling cape fire smoke . There parachutes , one , two , three… four , plane gyrated spin fell rest way ground , fluttering insensibly inside vivid pyre like shred colored tissue paper . One whole flight planes another squadron blasted apart . Yossarian sighed barrenly , day ’ work done . He listless sticky . The engines crooned mellifluously McWatt throttled back loiter allow rest planes flight catch . The abrupt stillness seemed alien artificial , little insidious . Yossarian unsnapped flak suit took helmet . He sighed , restlessly , closed eyes tried relax . “ Where ’ Orr ? ” someone asked suddenly intercom . Yossarian bounded one-syllable cry crackled anxiety provided rational explanation whole mysterious phenomenon flak Bologna : Orr ! He lunged forward bombsight search downward plexiglass reassuring sign Orr , drew flak like magnet undoubtedly attracted crack batteries whole Hermann Goering Division Bologna overnight wherever hell stationed day Orr still Rome . Aarfy launched forward instant later cracked Yossarian bridge nose sharp rim flak helmet . Yossarian cursed eyes flooded tears . “ There , ” Aarfy orated funereally , pointing dramatically hay wagon two horses standing barn gray stone farmhouse . “ Smashed bits . I guess numbers up. ” Yossarian swore Aarfy continued searching intently , cold compassionate kind fear little bouncy bizarre buck-toothed tentmate smashed Appleby ’ forehead open ping-pong racket scaring daylights Yossarian . At last Yossarian spotted two-engined , twin-ruddered plane flew green background forests field yellow farmland . One propellers feathered perfectly still , plane maintaining altitude holding proper course . Yossarian muttered unconscious prayer thankfulness flared Orr savagely ranting fusion resentment relief . “ That bastard ! ” began . “ That goddam stunted , red-faced , big-cheeked , curly-headed , buck-toothed rat bastard son bitch ! ” “ What ? ” said Aarfy . “ That dirty goddam midget-assed , apple-cheeked , goggle-eyed , undersized , buck-toothed , grinning , crazy sonofabitchin-bastard ! ” Yossarian sputtered . “ What ? ” “ Never mind ! ” “ I still ’ hear , ” Aarfy answered . Yossarian swung around methodically face Aarfy . “ You prick , ” began . “ Me ? ” “ You pompous , rotund , neighborly , vacuous , complacent… ” Aarfy unperturbed . Calmly struck wooden match sucked noisily pipe eloquent air benign magnanimous forgiveness . He smiled sociably opened mouth speak . Yossarian put hand Aarfy ’ mouth pushed away wearily . He shut eyes pretended sleep way back field would listen Aarfy see . At briefing room Yossarian made intelligence report Captain Black waited muttering suspense others Orr chugged sight overhead finally one good engine still keeping aloft gamely . Nobody breathed . Orr ’ landing gear would come . Yossarian hung around Orr crash-landed safely , stole first jeep could find key ignition raced back tent begin packing feverishly emergency rest leave decided take Rome , found Luciana invisible scar night . 16 LUCIANA He found Luciana sitting alone table Allied officers ’ night club , drunken Anzac major brought stupid enough desert ribald company singing comrades bar . “ All right , I ’ dance , ” said , Yossarian could even speak . “ But I ’ let sleep me. ” “ Who asked ? ” Yossarian asked . “ You ’ want sleep ? ” exclaimed surprise . “ I ’ want dance you. ” She seized Yossarian ’ hand pulled dance floor . She worse dancer even , threw synthetic jitterbug music uninhibited pleasure ever observed felt legs falling asleep boredom yanked dance floor toward table girl screwing still sitting tipsily one hand around Aarfy ’ neck , orange satin blouse still hanging open slovenly full white lacy brassière made dirty sex talk ostentatiously Huple , Orr , Kid Sampson Hungry Joe .

He answered finally tone sympathetic good humor . “ It means I want escort wherever hell I take next I rush back night club Aarfy leaves wonderful tomato ’ got without giving chance ask aunt friend must ’ like her. ” “ Come ? ” “ Subito , subito , ” taunted tenderly . “ Mamma waiting . Remember ? ” “ Si , si . Mamma. ” Yossarian let girl drag lovely Roman spring night almost mile reached chaotic bus depot honking horns , blazing red yellow lights echoing snarling vituperations unshaven bus drivers pouring loathsome , hair-raising curses , passengers strolling , unconcerned knots pedestrians clogging paths , ignored bumped buses began shouting curses back . Luciana vanished aboard one diminutive green vehicles , Yossarian hurried fast could way back cabaret bleary-eyed bleached blonde open orange satin blouse .

He could picture , walked , kind underclothing wore svelte feminine parts , filmy , smooth , clinging garments deepest black opalescent pastel radiance flowering lace borders fragrant tantalizing fumes pampered flesh scented bath salts rising germinating cloud blue-white breasts . He wished Aarfy , making obscene , brutal , cheerful love juicy drunken tart ’ give tinker ’ dam would never think . But Aarfy already back apartment Yossarian arrived , Yossarian gaped sense persecuted astonishment suffered morning Bologna malign cabalistic irremovable presence nose plane . “ What ? ” asked . “ That ’ right , ask ! ” Hungry Joe exclaimed rage . “ Make tell ’ ! ” With long , theatrical moan , Kid Sampson made pistol thumb forefinger blew brains . Huple , chewing away bulging wad bubble gum , drank everything callow , vacant expression fifteen-year old face . Aarfy tapping bowl pipe palm leisurely paced back forth corpulent self-approval , obviously delighted stir causing . “ Didn ’ go home girl ? ” Yossarian demanded . “ Oh , sure , I went home , ” Aarfy replied . “ You ’ think I going let try find way home alone , ? ” “ Wouldn ’ let stay ? ” “ Oh , wanted stay , right. ” Aarfy chuckled . “ Don ’ worry good old Aarfy .

When Luciana ready , Yossarian waited Hungry Joe ’ next charge yanked door open unexpectedly . Hungry Joe spilled forward room like floundering frog . Yossarian skipped nimbly around , guiding Luciana along behind apartment hallway . They bounced stairs great roistering clatter , laughing loud breathlessly knocking hilarious heads together time paused rest . Near bottom met Nately coming stopped laughing . Nately drawn , dirty unhappy . His tie twisted shirt rumpled , walked hands pockets .

She would allow walk beside strolled pavements soliciting servicemen , infuriated spied trailing distance . He free hang around apartment cared , certainty would . And would give nothing unless could pay . She found sex uninteresting . Nately wanted assurance going bed anyone unsavory someone knew . Captain Black always made point buy time came Rome , could torment Nately news thrown sweetheart another hump watch Nately eat liver related atrocious indignities forced submit . Luciana touched Nately ’ forlorn air , broke loudly robust laughter moment stepped outside sunny street Yossarian heard Hungry Joe beseeching window come back take clothes , really photographer Life magazine . Luciana fled mirthfully along sidewalk high white wedgies , pulling Yossarian along tow lusty ingenuous zeal displayed dance hall night every moment since .

The minute gone , Yossarian tore slip paper walked away direction , feeling much like big shot beautiful young girl like Luciana slept ask money . He pretty pleased looked dining room Red Cross building found eating breakfast dozens dozens servicemen kinds fantastic uniforms , surrounded images Luciana getting clothes clothes caressing haranguing tempestuously pink rayon chemise wore bed would take .

His system sturdy enough survive case someone else ’ malaria influenza scarcely discomfort . He could come people ’ tonsillectomies without suffering postoperative distress , even endure hernias hemorrhoids mild nausea revulsion . But much could go without getting sick . After ready bolt . He could relax hospital , since one expected anything . All expected hospital die get better , since perfectly right begin , getting better easy . Being hospital better Bologna flying Avignon Huple Dobbs controls Snowden dying back . There usually nearly many sick people inside hospital Yossarian saw outside hospital , generally fewer people inside hospital seriously sick . There much lower death rate inside hospital outside hospital , much healthier death rate . Few people died unnecessarily . People knew lot dying inside hospital made much neater , orderly job . They ’ dominate Death inside hospital , certainly made behave . They taught manners . They ’ keep Death , act like lady . People gave ghost delicacy taste inside hospital . There none crude , ugly ostentation dying common outside hospital . They blow mid-air like Kraft dead man Yossarian ’ tent , freeze death blazing summertime way Snowden frozen death spilling secret Yossarian back plane . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian tried comfort . “ There , there. ” They ’ take lam weirdly inside cloud way Clevinger done . They ’ explode blood clotted matter . They ’ drown get struck lightning , mangled machinery crushed landslides . They ’ get shot death hold-ups , strangled death rapes , stabbed death saloons , bludgeoned death axes parents children die summarily act God . Nobody choked death . People bled death like gentlemen operating room expired without comment oxygen tent . There none tricky now-you-see-me-now-you-don ’ business much vogue outside hospital , none now-I-am-and-now-I-ain ’ . There famines floods . Children ’ suffocate cradles iceboxes fall trucks . No one beaten death . People ’ stick heads ovens gas , jump front subway trains come plummeting like dead weights hotel windows whoosh ! , accelerating rate sixteen feet per second land hideous plop ! sidewalk die disgustingly public like alpaca sack full hairy strawberry ice cream , bleeding , pink toes awry . All things considered , Yossarian often preferred hospital , even though faults . The help tended officious , rules , heeded , restrictive , management meddlesome . Since sick people apt present , could always depend lively young crowd ward , entertainment always good . He forced admit hospitals altered steadily worse war continued one moved closer battlefront , deterioration quality guests becoming marked within combat zone effects booming wartime conditions apt make conspicuous immediately . The people got sicker sicker deeper moved combat , finally hospital last time soldier white , could sicker without dead , soon . The soldier white constructed entirely gauze , plaster thermometer , thermometer merely adornment left balanced empty dark hole bandages mouth early morning late afternoon Nurse Cramer Nurse Duckett right afternoon Nurse Cramer read thermometer discovered dead . Now Yossarian looked back , seemed Nurse Cramer , rather talkative Texan , murdered soldier white ; read thermometer reported found , soldier white might still lying alive exactly lying along , encased head toe plaster gauze strange , rigid legs elevated hips strange arms strung perpendicularly , four bulky limbs casts , four strange , useless limbs hoisted air taut wire cables fantastically long lead weights suspended darkly . Lying way might much life , life , decision terminate , Yossarian felt , hardly Nurse Cramer ’ . The soldier white like unrolled bandage hole like broken block stone harbor crooked zinc pipe jutting . The patients ward , Texan , shrank tenderhearted aversion moment set eyes morning night sneaked . They gathered soberly farthest recess ward gossiped malicious , offended undertones , rebelling presence ghastly imposition resenting malevolently nauseating truth bright reminder . They shared common dread would begin moaning . “ I ’ know I ’ begin moaning , ” dashing young fighter pilot golden mustache grieved forlornly . “ It means ’ moan night , , ’ able tell time. ” No sound came soldier white time . The ragged round hole mouth deep jet black showed sign lip , teeth , palate tongue . The one ever came close enough look affable Texan , came close enough several times day chat votes decent folk , opening conversation unvarying greeting : “ What say , fella ? How coming along ? ” The rest men avoided regulation maroon corduroy bathrobes unraveling flannel pajamas , wondering gloomily soldier white , really like inside . “ He ’ right , I tell , ” Texan would report back encouragingly social visits . “ Deep inside ’ really regular guy . He ’ feeling little shy insecure ’ know anybody ’ talk . Why ’ step right introduce ? He ’ hurt you. ” “ What goddam hell talking ? ” Dunbar demanded . “ Does even know ’ talking ? ” “ Sure knows I ’ talking . He ’ stupid . There ’ nothing wrong him. ” “ Can hear ? ” “ Well , I ’ know hear , I ’ sure knows I ’ talking about. ” “ Does hole mouth ever move ? ” “ Now , kind crazy question ? ” Texan asked uneasily . “ How tell ’ breathing never moves ? ” “ How tell ’ ? ” “ Does pads eyes underneath bandage face ? ” “ Does ever wiggle toes move tips fingers ? ” The Texan backed away mounting confusion . “ Now , kind crazy question ? You fellas must crazy something . Why ’ walk right get acquainted ? He ’ real nice guy , I tell you. ” The soldier white like stuffed sterilized mummy real nice guy . Nurse Duckett Nurse Cramer kept spick-and-span . They brushed bandages often whiskbroom scrubbed plaster casts arms , legs , shoulders , chest pelvis soapy water . Working round tin metal polish , waxed dim gloss dull zinc pipe rising cement groin . With damp dish towels wiped dust several times day slim black rubber tubes leading two large stoppered jars , one , hanging post beside bed , dripping fluid arm constantly slit bandages , almost sight floor , drained fluid away zinc pipe rising groin . Both young nurses polished glass jars unceasingly . They proud housework . The solicitous two Nurse Cramer , shapely , pretty , sexless girl wholesome unattractive face . Nurse Cramer cute nose radiant , blooming complexion dotted fetching sprays adorable freckles Yossarian detested . She touched deeply soldier white . Her virtuous , pale-blue , saucerlike eyes flooded leviathan tears unexpected occasions made Yossarian mad . “ How hell know ’ even ? ” asked . “ Don ’ dare talk way ! ” replied indignantly . “ Well , ? You ’ even know ’ really him. ” “ Who ? ” “ Whoever ’ supposed bandages . You might really weeping somebody else . How know ’ even alive ? ” “ What terrible thing say ! ” Nurse Cramer exclaimed . “ Now , get right bed stop making jokes him. ” “ I ’ making jokes . Anybody might . For know , might even Mudd. ” “ What talking ? ” Nurse Cramer pleaded quavering voice . “ Maybe ’ dead man is. ” “ What dead man ? ” “ I ’ got dead man tent nobody throw . His name Mudd. ” Nurse Cramer ’ face blanched turned Dunbar desperately aid . “ Make stop saying things like , ” begged . “ Maybe ’ one inside , ” Dunbar suggested helpfully . “ Maybe sent bandages joke. ” She stepped away Dunbar alarm . “ You ’ crazy , ” cried , glancing imploringly . “ You ’ crazy. ” Nurse Duckett showed chased back beds Nurse Cramer changed stoppered jars soldier white . Changing jars soldier white trouble , since clear fluid dripped back inside apparent loss . When jar feeding inside elbow empty , jar floor full , two simply uncoupled respective hoses reversed quickly liquid could dripped right back . Changing jars trouble anyone men watched changed every hour baffled procedure . “ Why ’ hook two jars eliminate middleman ? ” artillery captain Yossarian stopped playing chess inquired . “ What hell need ? ” “ I wonder deserve , ” warrant officer malaria mosquito bite ass lamented Nurse Cramer read thermometer discovered soldier white dead . “ He went war , ” fighter pilot golden mustache surmised . “ We went war , ” Dunbar countered . “ That ’ I mean , ” warrant officer malaria continued . “ Why ? There ’ seem logic system rewards punishment . Look happened . If I gotten syphilis dose clap five minutes passion beach instead damned mosquito bite , I could see justice . But malaria ? Malaria ? Who explain malaria consequence fornication ? ” The warrant officer shook head numb astonishment . “ What ? ” Yossarian said . “ I stepped tent Marrakech one night get bar candy caught dose clap Wac I never even saw hissed bushes . All I really wanted bar candy , could turn ? ” “ That sounds like dose clap , right , ” warrant officer agreed . “ But I ’ still got somebody else ’ malaria . Just I ’ like see things sort straightened , person getting exactly deserves . It might give confidence universe. ” “ I ’ got somebody else ’ three hundred thousand dollars , ” dashing young fighter captain golden mustache admitted . “ I ’ goofing since day I born . I cheated way prep school college , I ’ ever since shacking pretty girls think I ’ make good husband . I ’ got ambition . The thing I want war marry girl ’ got money I shack lots pretty girls . The three hundred thousand bucks left I born grandfather made fortune selling international scale . I know I ’ deserve , I ’ damned I give back . I wonder really belongs to. ” “ Maybe belongs father , ” Dunbar conjectured . “ He spent lifetime hard work never could make enough money even send sister college . He ’ dead , might well keep it. ” “ Now , find malaria belongs ’ set . It ’ I ’ got anything malaria . I ’ soon goldbrick malaria anything else . It ’ I feel injustice committed . Why I somebody else ’ malaria dose clap ? ” “ I ’ got dose clap , ” Yossarian told . “ I ’ got keep flying combat missions dose kill me. ” “ That makes even worse . What ’ justice ? ” “ I friend named Clevinger two half weeks ago used see plenty justice it. ” “ It ’ highest kind justice , ” Clevinger gloated , clapping hands merry laugh . “ I ’ help thinking Hippolytus Euripides , early licentiousness Theseus probably responsible asceticism son helps bring tragedy ruins . If nothing else , episode Wac teach evil sexual immorality. ” “ It teaches evil candy. ” “ Can ’ see ’ exactly without blame predicament ’ ? ” Clevinger continued undisguised relish . “ If ’ laid hospital venereal disease ten days back Africa , might finished twenty-five missions time sent home Colonel Nevers killed Colonel Cathcart came replace him. ” “ And ? ” Yossarian replied . “ You never got clap Marrakech ’ predicament. ” “ I ’ know , ” confessed Clevinger , trace mock concern . “ I guess I must done something bad time. ” “ Do really believe ? ” Clevinger laughed . “ No , course . I like kid along little. ” There many dangers Yossarian keep track . There Hitler , Mussolini Tojo , example , kill . There Lieutenant Scheisskopf fanaticism parades bloated colonel big fat mustache fanaticism retribution , wanted kill , . There Appleby , Havermeyer , Black Korn . There Nurse Cramer Nurse Duckett , almost certain wanted dead , Texan C.I.D . man , doubt .

There billions conscientious body cells oxidating away day night like dumb animals complicated job keeping alive healthy , every one potential traitor foe . There many diseases took truly diseased mind even think often Hungry Joe . Hungry Joe collected lists fatal diseases arranged alphabetical order could put finger without delay one wanted worry . He grew upset whenever misplaced could add list , would go rushing cold sweat Doc Daneeka help . “ Give Ewing ’ tumor , ” Yossarian advised Doc Daneeka , would come Yossarian help handling Hungry Joe , “ follow melanoma . Hungry Joe likes lingering diseases , likes fulminating ones even more. ” Doc Daneeka never heard either . “ How manage keep many diseases like ? ” inquired high professional esteem . “ I learn hospital I study Reader ’ Digest. ” Yossarian many ailments afraid sometimes tempted turn hospital good spend rest life stretched inside oxygen tent battery specialists nurses seated one side bed twenty-four hours day waiting something go wrong least one surgeon knife poised , ready jump forward begin cutting away moment became necessary . Aneurisms , instance ; else could ever defend time aneurism aorta ? Yossarian felt much safer inside hospital outside hospital , even though loathed surgeon knife much ever loathed anyone . He could start screaming inside hospital people would least come running try help ; outside hospital would throw prison ever started screaming things felt everyone ought start screaming , would put hospital . One things wanted start screaming surgeon ’ knife almost certain waiting everyone else lived long enough die . He wondered often would ever recognize first chill , flush , twinge , ache , belch , sneeze , stain , lethargy , vocal slip , loss balance lapse memory would signal inevitable beginning inevitable end . He afraid also Doc Daneeka would still refuse help went jumping Major Major ’ office , right . “ You think ’ got something afraid ? ” Doc Daneeka demanded , lifting delicate immaculate dark head chest gaze Yossarian irascibly moment lachrymose eyes . “ What ? My precious medical skills rusting away lousy island doctors cleaning . Do think I enjoy sitting day day refusing help ? I ’ mind much I could refuse help back States place like Rome . But saying ’ easy , either. ” “ Then stop saying . Ground me. ” “ I ’ ground , ” Doc Daneeka mumbled . “ How many times told ? ” “ Yes . Major Major told ’ one squadron ground me. ” Doc Daneeka stunned . “ Major Major told ? When ? ” “ When I tackled ditch. ” “ Major Major told ?

They ’ really shoot , would ? I ’ got fifty-one. ” “ Why ’ least finish fifty-five take stand ? ” Doc Daneeka advised . “ With bitching , ’ never finished tour duty even once. ” “ How hell I ? The colonel keeps raising every time I get close. ” “ You never finish missions keep running hospital going Rome . You ’ much , stronger position fifty-five finished refused fly . Then maybe I ’ see I could do. ” “ Do promise ? ” “ I promise. ” “ What promise ? ” “ I promise maybe I ’ think something help finish fifty-five missions get McWatt put name flight log I draw flight pay without going plane .

Take pulse. ” Yossarian also worried Ewing ’ tumor melanoma . Catastrophes lurking everywhere , numerous count . When contemplated many diseases potential accidents threatening , positively astounded managed survive good health long . It miraculous . Each day faced another dangerous mission mortality . And surviving twenty-eight years . 18 THE SOLDIER WHO SAW EVERYTHING TWICE Yossarian owed good health exercise , fresh air , teamwork good sportsmanship ; get away first discovered hospital . When physical-education officer Lowery Field ordered everyone fall calisthenics one afternoon , Yossarian , private , reported instead dispensary said pain right side . “ Beat , ” said doctor duty , crossword puzzle . “ We ’ tell beat , ” said corporal . “ There ’ new directive abdominal complaints . We keep observation five days many dying make beat it. ” “ All right , ” grumbled doctor . “ Keep observation five days make beat it. ” They took Yossarian ’ clothes away put ward , happy one snoring nearby . In morning helpful young English intern popped ask liver . “ I think ’ appendix ’ bothering , ” Yossarian told . “ Your appendix good , ” Englishman declared jaunty authority . “ If appendix goes wrong , take back active duty almost time . But come us liver complaint fool us weeks . The liver , see , large , ugly mystery us . If ’ ever eaten liver know I mean . We ’ pretty sure today liver exists fairly good idea whenever ’ ’ supposed . Beyond , ’ really dark . After , liver ? My father , example , died cancer liver never sick day life right till moment killed . Never felt twinge pain . In way , bad , since I hated father . Lust mother , know. ” “ What ’ English medical officer duty ? ” Yossarian wanted know . The officer laughed . “ I ’ tell I see tomorrow morning . And throw silly ice bag away die pneumonia. ” Yossarian never saw . That one nice things doctors hospital ; never saw second time . They came went simply disappeared . In place English intern next day , arrived group doctors never seen ask appendix . “ There ’ nothing wrong appendix , ” Yossarian informed . “ The doctor yesterday said liver. ” “ Maybe liver , ” replied white-haired officer charge . “ What blood count show ? ” “ He ’ blood count. ” “ Have one taken right away . We ’ afford take chances patient condition . We ’ got keep covered case dies. ” He made notation clipboard spoke Yossarian . “ In meantime , keep ice bag . It ’ important. ” “ I ’ ice bag on. ” “ Well , get one . There must ice bag around somewhere . And let someone know pain becomes unendurable. ” At end ten days , new group doctors came Yossarian bad news ; perfect health get . He rescued nick time patient across aisle began see everything twice . Without warning , patient sat bed shouted . “ I see everything twice ! ” A nurse screamed orderly fainted . Doctors came running every direction needles , lights , tubes , rubber mallets oscillating metal tines . They rolled complicated instruments wheels . There enough patient go around , specialists pushed forward line raw tempers snapped colleagues front hurry give somebody else chance . A colonel large forehead horn-rimmed glasses soon arrived diagnosis . “ It ’ meningitis , ” called emphatically , waving others back . “ Although Lord knows ’ slightest reason thinking so. ” “ Then pick meningitis ? ” inquired major suave chuckle . “ Why , let ’ say , acute nephritis ? ” “ Because I ’ meningitis man , ’ , acute-nephritis man , ” retorted colonel . “ And I ’ going give kidney birds without struggle . I first. ” In end , doctors accord . They agreed idea wrong soldier saw everything twice , rolled away room corridor quarantined everyone else ward fourteen days . Thanksgiving Day came went without fuss Yossarian still hospital . The bad thing turkey dinner , even pretty good . It rational Thanksgiving ever spent , took sacred oath spend every future Thanksgiving Day cloistered shelter hospital . He broke sacred oath next year , spent holiday hotel room instead intellectual conversation Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife , Dori Duz ’ dog tags occasion henpecked Yossarian sententiously cynical callous Thanksgiving , even though ’ believe God much ’ . “ I ’ probably good atheist , ” speculated boastfully . “ But even I feel great deal thankful ’ ashamed show it. ” “ Name one thing I ’ got thankful , ” Yossarian challenged without interest . “ Well… ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife mused paused moment ponder dubiously . “ Me. ” “ Oh , come , ” scoffed . She arched eyebrows surprise . “ Aren ’ thankful ? ” asked . She frowned peevishly , pride wounded . “ I ’ shack , know , ” told cold dignity . “ My husband whole squadron full aviation cadets would happy shack commanding officer ’ wife added fillip would give them. ” Yossarian decided change subject . “ Now ’ changing subject , ” pointed diplomatically . “ I ’ bet I name two things miserable every one name thankful for. ” “ Be thankful ’ got , ” insisted . “ I , honey . But I ’ also goddam good miserable I ’ Dori Duz , . Or hundreds girls women I ’ see want short lifetime ’ able go bed even once. ” “ Be thankful ’ healthy. ” “ Be bitter ’ going stay way. ” “ Be glad ’ even alive. ” “ Be furious ’ going die. ” “ Things could much worse , ” cried . “ They could one hell lot better , ” answered heatedly . “ You ’ naming one thing , ” protested . “ You said could name two. ” “ And ’ tell God works mysterious ways , ” Yossarian continued , hurtling objection . “ There ’ nothing mysterious . He ’ working . He ’ playing . Or else He ’ forgotten us . That ’ kind God people talk about-a country bumpkin , clumsy , bungling , brainless , conceited , uncouth hayseed . Good God , much reverence Supreme Being finds necessary include phenomena phlegm tooth decay His divine system creation ? What world running warped , evil , scatological mind His He robbed old people power control bowel movements ? Why world He ever create pain ? ” “ Pain ? ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife pounced upon word victoriously . “ Pain useful symptom . Pain warning us bodily dangers. ” “ And created dangers ? ” Yossarian demanded . He laughed caustically . “ Oh , He really charitable us He gave us pain ! Why ’ He used doorbell instead notify us , one His celestial choirs ? Or system blue-and-red neon tubes right middle person ’ forehead . Any jukebox manufacturer worth salt could done . Why ’ He ? ” “ People would certainly look silly walking around red neon tubes middle foreheads. ” “ They certainly look beautiful writhing agony stupefied morphine , ’ ? What colossal , immortal blunderer ! When consider opportunity power He really job , look stupid , ugly little mess He made instead , His sheer incompetence almost staggering . It ’ obvious He never met payroll . Why , self-respecting businessman would hire bungler like Him even shipping clerk ! ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife turned ashen disbelief ogling alarm . “ You ’ better talk way Him , honey , ” warned reprovingly low hostile voice . “ He might punish you. ” “ Isn ’ He punishing enough ? ” Yossarian snorted resentfully . “ You know , ’ let Him get away . Oh , , certainly ’ let Him get away scot free sorrow He ’ caused us . Someday I ’ going make Him pay . I know . On Judgment Day . Yes , That ’ day I ’ close enough reach grab little yokel His neck and- “ “ Stop ! Stop ! ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife screamed suddenly , began beating ineffectually head fists . “ Stop ! ” Yossarian ducked behind arm protection slammed away feminine fury seconds , caught determinedly wrists forced gently back bed . “ What hell getting upset ? ” asked bewilderedly tone contrite amusement . “ I thought ’ believe God. ” “ I ’ , ” sobbed , bursting violently tears . “ But God I ’ believe good God , God , merciful God . He ’ mean stupid God make Him be. ” Yossarian laughed turned arms loose . “ Let ’ little religious freedom us , ” proposed obligingly . “ You ’ believe God want , I ’ believe God I want . Is deal ? ” That illogical Thanksgiving could ever remember spending , thoughts returned wishfully halcyon fourteen-day quarantine hospital year ; even idyll ended tragic note ; still good health quarantine period , told get go war . Yossarian sat bed heard bad news shouted . “ I see everything twice ! ” Pandemonium broke loose ward . The specialists came running directions ringed circle scrutiny confining could feel humid breath various noses blowing uncomfortably upon different sectors body . They went snooping eyes ears tiny beams light , assaulted legs feet rubber hammers vibrating forks , drew blood veins , held anything handy see periphery vision . The leader team doctors dignified , solicitous gentleman held one finger directly front Yossarian demanded , “ How many fingers see ? ” “ Two , ” said Yossarian . “ How many fingers see ? ” asked doctor , holding two . “ Two , ” said Yossarian . “ And many ? ” asked doctor , holding none . “ Two , ” said Yossarian . The doctor ’ face wreathed smile . “ By Jove , ’ right , ” declared jubilantly . “ He see everything twice. ” They rolled Yossarian away stretcher room soldier saw everything twice quarantined everyone else ward another fourteen days . “ I see everything twice ! ” soldier saw everything twice shouted rolled Yossarian . “ I see everything twice ! ” Yossarian shouted back loudly , secret wink . “ The walls ! The walls ! ” soldier cried . “ Move back walls ! ” “ The walls ! The walls ! ” Yossarian cried . “ Move back walls ! ” One doctors pretended shove wall back . “ Is far enough ? ” The soldier saw everything twice nodded weakly sank back bed . Yossarian nodded weakly , eying talented roommate great humility admiration . He knew presence master . His talented roommate obviously person studied emulated . During night , talented roommate died , Yossarian decided followed far enough . “ I see everything ! ” cried quickly . A new group specialists came pounding bedside instruments find true . “ How many fingers see ? ” asked leader , holding one . “ One. ” The doctor held two fingers . “ How many fingers see ? ” “ One. ” The doctor held ten fingers . “ And many ? ” “ One. ” The doctor turned doctors amazement . “ He see everything ! ” exclaimed . “ We made better. ” “ And time , , ” announced doctor Yossarian next found alone , tall , torpedo-shaped congenial man unshaven growth brown beard pack cigarettes shirt pocket chain-smoked insouciantly leaned wall . “ There relatives see . Oh , ’ worry , ” added laugh . “ Not relatives . It ’ mother , father brother chap died . They ’ traveled way New York see dying soldier , ’ handiest one ’ got. ” “ What talking ? ” Yossarian asked suspiciously . “ I ’ dying. ” “ Of course ’ dying . We ’ dying .

To scientist , dying boys equal . I proposition . You let come look minutes I ’ tell anyone ’ lying liver symptoms. ” Yossarian drew back farther . “ You know ? ” “ Of course I . Give us credit. ” The doctor chuckled amiably lit another cigarette . “ How expect anyone believe liver condition keep squeezing nurses ’ tits every time get chance ? You ’ going give sex want convince people ’ got ailing liver. ” “ That ’ hell price pay keep alive . Why ’ turn knew I faking ? ” “ Why devil I ? ” asked doctor flicker surprise . “ We ’ business illusion together .

Well , say ? All ’ got lie minutes die little . Is asking much ? ” “ All right , ” Yossarian gave . “ If ’ minutes promise wait right outside. ” He warmed role . “ Say , ’ wrap bandage around effect ? ” “ That sounds like splendid idea , ” applauded doctor . They wrapped batch bandages around Yossarian . A team medical orderlies installed tan shades two windows lowered douse room depressing shadows . Yossarian suggested flowers doctor sent orderly find two small bunches fading ones strong sickening smell . When everything place , made Yossarian get back bed lie . Then admitted visitors .

He blustering , intrepid bully brooded inconsolably terrible ineradicable impressions knew kept making people prominence scarcely aware even alive . Everybody persecuting . Colonel Cathcart lived wits unstable , arithmetical world black eyes feathers cap , overwhelming imaginary triumphs catastrophic imaginary defeats . He oscillated hourly anguish exhilaration , multiplying fantastically grandeur victories exaggerating tragically seriousness defeats . Nobody ever caught napping . If word reached General Dreedle General Peckem seen smiling , frowning , neither , could make rest found acceptable interpretation grumbled mulishly Colonel Korn persuaded relax take things easy . Lieutenant Colonel Korn loyal , indispensable ally got Colonel Cathcart ’ nerves . Colonel Cathcart pledged eternal gratitude Colonel Korn ingenious moves devised furious afterward realized might work . Colonel Cathcart greatly indebted Colonel Korn like . The two close . Colonel Cathcart jealous Colonel Korn ’ intelligence remind often Colonel Korn still lieutenant colonel , even though almost ten years older Colonel Cathcart , Colonel Korn obtained education state university . Colonel Cathcart bewailed miserable fate given invaluable assistant someone common Colonel Korn . It degrading depend thoroughly person educated state university . If someone become indispensable , Colonel Cathcart lamented , could easily someone wealthy well groomed , someone better family mature Colonel Korn treat Colonel Cathcart ’ desire become general frivolously Colonel Cathcart secretly suspected Colonel Korn secretly . Colonel Cathcart wanted general desperately willing try anything , even religion , summoned chaplain office late one morning week raised number missions sixty pointed abruptly toward desk copy The Saturday Evening Post . The colonel wore khaki shirt collar wide open , exposing shadow tough black bristles beard egg-white neck , spongy hanging underlip . He person never tanned , kept sun much possible avoid burning . The colonel head taller chaplain twice broad , swollen , overbearing authority made chaplain feel frail sickly contrast . “ Take look , Chaplain , ” Colonel Cathcart directed , screwing cigarette holder seating affluently swivel chair behind desk . “ Let know think. ” The chaplain looked open magazine compliantly saw editorial spread dealing American bomber group England whose chaplain said prayers briefing room mission . The chaplain almost wept happiness realized colonel going holler . The two hardly spoken since tumultuous evening Colonel Cathcart thrown officers ’ club General Dreedle ’ bidding Chief White Halfoat punched Colonel Moodus nose . The chaplain ’ initial fear colonel intended reprimanding gone back officers ’ club without permission evening . He gone Yossarian Dunbar two come unexpectedly tent clearing woods ask join . Intimidated Colonel Cathcart , nevertheless found easier brave displeasure decline thoughtful invitation two new friends , met one hospital visits weeks worked effectively insulate myriad social vicissitudes involved official duty live closest terms familiarity nine hundred unfamiliar officers enlisted men thought odd duck . The chaplain glued eyes pages magazine . He studied photograph twice read captions intently organized response colonel ’ question grammatically complete sentence rehearsed reorganized mind considerable number times able finally muster courage reply . “ I think saying prayers mission moral highly laudatory procedure , sir , ” offered timidly , waited . “ Yeah , ” said colonel . “ But I want know think ’ work here. ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered chaplain moments . “ I think would. ” “ Then I ’ like give try. ” The colonel ’ ponderous , farinaceous cheeks tinted suddenly glowing patches enthusiasm . He rose feet began walking around excitedly . “ Look much good ’ done people England . Here ’ picture colonel The Saturday Evening Post whose chaplain conducts prayers mission . If prayers work , work us . Maybe say prayers , ’ put picture The Saturday Evening Post. ” The colonel sat smiled distantly lavish contemplation . The chaplain hint expected say next . With pensive expression oblong , rather pale face , allowed gaze settle several high bushels filled red plum tomatoes stood rows walls . He pretended concentrate reply . After realized staring rows rows bushels red plum tomatoes grew intrigued question bushels brimming red plum tomatoes group commander ’ office forgot completely discussion prayer meetings Colonel Cathcart , genial digression , inquired : “ Would like buy , Chaplain ? They come right farm Colonel Korn I hills . I let bushel wholesale. ” “ Oh , , sir . I ’ think so. ” “ That ’ quite right , ” colonel assured liberally . “ You ’ . Milo glad snap produce . These picked yesterday . Notice firm ripe , like young girl ’ breasts. ” The chaplain blushed , colonel understood made mistake . He lowered head shame , cumbersome face burning . His fingers felt gross unwieldy . He hated chaplain venomously chaplain making coarse blunder observation circumstances , knew , would considered witty urbane . He tried miserably recall means extricating devastating embarrassment . He recalled instead chaplain captain , straightened shocked outraged gasp . His cheeks grew tight fury thought duped humiliation man almost age still captain , swung upon chaplain avengingly look murderous antagonism chaplain began tremble . The colonel punished sadistically long , glowering , malignant , hateful , silent stare . “ We speaking something else , ” reminded chaplain cuttingly last . “ We speaking firm , ripe breasts beautiful young girls something else entirely . We speaking conducting religious services briefing room mission . Is reason ’ ? ” “ No , sir , ” chaplain mumbled . “ Then ’ begin afternoon ’ mission. ” The colonel ’ hostility softened gradually applied details . “ Now , I want give lot thought kind prayers ’ going say . I ’ want anything heavy sad . I ’ like keep light snappy , something send boys feeling pretty good . Do know I mean ? I ’ want Kingdom God Valley Death stuff . That ’ negative . What making sour face ? ” “ I ’ sorry , sir , ” chaplain stammered . “ I happened thinking Twenty-third Psalm said that. ” “ How one go ? ” “ That ’ one referring , sir . ‘ The Lord shepherd ; I- ‘ ” “ That ’ one I referring . It ’ . What else got ? ” “ ’ Save , O God ; waters come unto- ‘ ” “ No waters , ” colonel decided , blowing ruggedly cigarette holder flipping butt combed-brass ash tray . “ Why ’ try something musical ? How harps willows ? ” “ That rivers Babylon , sir , ” chaplain replied . “ ’ …there sat , yea , wept , remembered Zion. ’ ” “ Zion ? Let ’ forget one right . I ’ like know one even got . Haven ’ got anything humorous stays away waters valleys God ? I ’ like keep away subject religion altogether can. ” The chaplain apologetic . “ I ’ sorry , sir , prayers I know rather somber tone make least passing reference God. ” “ Then let ’ get new ones . The men already enough bitching missions I send without rubbing sermons God death Paradise . Why ’ take positive approach ? Why ’ pray something good , like tighter bomb pattern , example ? Couldn ’ pray tighter bomb pattern ? ” “ Well , yes , sir , I suppose , ” chaplain answered hesitantly . “ You ’ even need ’ wanted . You could yourself. ” “ I know I could , ” colonel responded tartly . “ But think ’ ? I could shop food , , ’ Milo ’ job , ’ ’ every group area . Your job lead us prayer , ’ going lead us prayer tighter bomb pattern every mission . Is clear ? I think tighter bomb pattern something really worth praying . It feather caps General Peckem . General Peckem feels makes much nicer aerial photograph bombs explode close together. ” “ General Peckem , sir ? ” “ That ’ right , Chaplain , ” colonel replied , chuckling paternally chaplain ’ look puzzlement . “ I ’ want get around , looks like General Dreedle finally way General Peckem slated replace . Frankly , I ’ going sorry see happen . General Peckem good man , I think ’ much better . On hand , might never take place , ’ still remain General Dreedle . Frankly , I ’ sorry see happen either , General Dreedle another good man , I think ’ much better . I hope ’ going keep hat , Chaplain . I ’ want either one get idea I throwing support side other. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ That ’ good , ” colonel exclaimed , stood jovially . “ But gossip ’ getting us The Saturday Evening Post , eh , Chaplain ? Let ’ see kind procedure evolve . Incidentally , Chaplain , word beforehand Colonel Korn . Understand ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” Colonel Cathcart began tramping back forth reflectively narrow corridors left bushels plum tomatoes desk wooden chairs center room . “ I suppose ’ keep waiting outside briefing , information classified . We slip Major Danby synchronizing watches . I ’ think ’ anything secret right time . We ’ allocate minute half schedule . Will minute half enough ? ” “ Yes , sir . If ’ include time necessary excuse atheists room admit enlisted men. ” Colonel Cathcart stopped tracks . “ What atheists ? ” bellowed defensively , whole manner changing flash one virtuous belligerent denial . “ There atheists outfit ! Atheism law , ’ ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ It ’ ? ” The colonel surprised . “ Then ’ un-American , ’ ? ” “ I ’ sure , sir , ” answered chaplain . “ Well , I ! ” colonel declared . “ I ’ going disrupt religious services accommodate bunch lousy atheists . They ’ getting special privileges . They stay right pray rest us . And ’ enlisted men ? Just hell get act ? ” The chaplain felt face flush . “ I ’ sorry , sir . I assumed would want enlisted men present , since would going along mission. ” “ Well , I ’ . They ’ got God chaplain , ’ ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ What talking ? You mean pray God ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And He listens ? ” “ I think , sir. ” “ Well , I ’ damned , ” remarked colonel , snorted quizzical amusement . His spirits drooped suddenly moment later , ran hand nervously short , black , graying curls . “ Do really think ’ good idea let enlisted men ? ” asked concern . “ I think proper , sir. ” “ I ’ like keep , ” confided colonel , began cracking knuckles savagely wandered back forth . “ Oh , ’ get wrong , Chaplain . It ’ I think enlisted men dirty , common inferior . It ’ ’ enough room . Frankly , though , I ’ soon officers enlisted men ’ fraternize briefing room . They see enough mission , seems . Some best friends enlisted men , understand , ’ close I care let come . Honestly , Chaplain , ’ want sister marry enlisted man , would ? ” “ My sister enlisted man , sir , ” chaplain replied . The colonel stopped tracks eyed chaplain sharply make certain ridiculed . “ Just mean remark , Chaplain ? Are trying funny ? ” “ Oh , , sir , ” chaplain hastened explain look excruciating discomfort . “ She ’ master sergeant Marines. ” The colonel never liked chaplain loathed distrusted . He experienced keen premonition danger wondered chaplain plotting , chaplain ’ reticent , unimpressive manner really sinister disguise masking fiery ambition , way deep , crafty unscrupulous . There something funny chaplain , colonel soon detected . The chaplain standing stiffly attention , colonel forgotten put ease . Let stay way , colonel decided vindictively , show boss safeguard loss dignity might devolve acknowledging omission . Colonel Cathcart drawn hypnotically toward window massive , dull stare moody introspection . The enlisted men always treacherous , decided . He looked downward mournful gloom skeet-shooting range ordered built officers headquarters staff , recalled mortifying afternoon General Dreedle tongue-lashed ruthlessly front Colonel Korn Major Danby ordered throw open range enlisted men officers combat duty . The skeet-shooting range real black eye , Colonel Cathcart forced conclude . He positive General Dreedle never forgotten , even though positive General Dreedle ’ even remember , really unjust , Colonel Cathcart lamented , since idea skeet-shooting range real feather cap , even though real black eye . Colonel Cathcart helpless assess exactly much ground gained lost goddam skeet-shooting range wished Colonel Korn office right evaluate entire episode still one time assuage fears . It perplexing , discouraging . Colonel Cathcart took cigarette holder mouth , stood end inside pocket shirt , began gnawing fingernails hands grievously . Everybody , sick soul Colonel Korn moment crisis help decide prayer meetings . He almost faith chaplain , still captain . “ Do think , ” asked , “ keeping enlisted men might interfere chances getting results ? ” The chaplain hesitated , feeling unfamiliar ground . “ Yes , sir , ” replied finally . “ I think ’ conceivable action could interfere chances prayers tighter bomb pattern answered. ” “ I ’ even thinking ! ” cried colonel , eyes blinking splashing like puddles . “ You mean God might even decide punish giving us looser bomb pattern ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said chaplain . “ It ’ conceivable He might. ” “ The hell , , ” colonel asserted huff independence . “ I ’ going set damned prayer meetings make things worse are. ” With scornful snicker , settled behind desk , replaced empty cigarette holder mouth lapsed parturient silence moments . “ Now I think , ” confessed , much chaplain , “ men pray God probably ’ hot idea anyway . The editors The Saturday Evening Post might co-operated. ” The colonel abandoned project remorse , conceived entirely hoped unveil striking demonstration everyone real need Colonel Korn . Once gone , glad rid , troubled start danger instituting plan without first checking Colonel Korn . He heaved immense sigh contentment . He much higher opinion idea abandoned , made wise decision , felt , , important , made wise decision without consulting Colonel Korn . “ Will , sir ? ” asked chaplain . “ Yeah , ” said Colonel Cathcart . “ Unless ’ got something else suggest. ” “ No , sir . Only… ” The colonel lifted eyes though affronted studied chaplain aloof distrust . “ Only , Chaplain ? ” “ Sir , ” said chaplain , “ men upset since raised number missions sixty . They ’ asked speak it. ” The colonel silent . The chaplain ’ face reddened roots sandy hair waited . The colonel kept squirming long time fixed , uninterested look devoid emotion . “ Tell ’ war going , ” advised finally flat voice . “ Thank , sir , I , ” chaplain replied flood gratitude colonel finally said something . “ They wondering ’ requisition replacement crews waiting Africa take places let go home. ” “ That ’ administrative matter , ” colonel said . “ It ’ none business. ” He pointed languidly toward wall . “ Help plum tomato , Chaplain . Go ahead , ’ me. ” “ Thank , sir . Sir- “ “ Don ’ mention . How like living woods , Chaplain ? Is everything hunky dory ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ That ’ good . You get touch us need anything. ” “ Yes , sir . Thank , sir . Sir- “ “ Thanks dropping around , Chaplain . I ’ got work . You ’ let know think anything getting names The Saturday Evening Post , ’ ? ” “ Yes , sir , I will. ” The chaplain braced prodigious effort plunged ahead brazenly . “ I ’ particularly concerned condition one bombardiers , sir . Yossarian. ” The colonel glanced quickly start vague recognition . “ Who ? ” asked alarm . “ Yossarian , sir. ” “ Yossarian ? ” “ Yes , sir . Yossarian . He ’ bad way , sir . I ’ afraid ’ able suffer much longer without something desperate. ” “ Is fact , Chaplain ? ” “ Yes , sir . I ’ afraid is. ” The colonel thought heavy silence moments . “ Tell trust God , ” advised finally . “ Thank , sir , ” said chaplain . “ I will. ” 20 CORPORAL WHITCOMB The late-August morning sun hot steamy , breeze balcony . The chaplain moved slowly . He downcast burdened self-reproach stepped without noise colonel ’ office rubber-soled rubber-heeled brown shoes . He hated construed cowardice . He intended take much stronger stand Colonel Cathcart matter sixty missions , speak courage , logic eloquence subject begun feel deeply . Instead failed miserably , choked face opposition stronger personality . It familiar , ignominious experience , opinion low . He choked even second later spied Colonel Korn ’ tubby monochrome figure trotting curved , wide , yellow stone staircase toward lackadaisical haste great dilapidated lobby lofty walls cracked dark marble circular floor cracked grimy tile . The chaplain even frightened Colonel Korn Colonel Cathcart . The swarthy , middle-aged lieutenant colonel rimless , icy glasses faceted , bald , domelike pate always touching sensitively tips splayed fingers disliked chaplain impolite frequently . He kept chaplain constant state terror curt , derisive tongue knowing , cynical eyes chaplain never brave enough meet accidental second . Inevitably , chaplain ’ attention , cowered meekly , focused Colonel Korn ’ midriff , shirttails bunching inside sagging belt ballooning waist gave appearance slovenly girth made seem inches shorter middle height . Colonel Korn untidy disdainful man oily skin deep , hard lines running almost straight nose crepuscular jowls square , clefted chin . His face dour , glanced chaplain without recognition two drew close staircase prepared pass . “ Hiya , Father , ” said tonelessly without looking chaplain . “ How ’ going ? ” “ Good morning , sir , ” chaplain replied , discerning wisely Colonel Korn expected nothing way response . Colonel Korn proceeding stairs without slackening pace , chaplain resisted temptation remind Catholic Anabaptist , therefore neither necessary correct address Father . He almost certain Colonel Korn remembered calling Father look bland innocence another one Colonel Korn ’ methods taunting Anabaptist . Colonel Korn halted without warning almost came whirling back upon chaplain glare infuriated suspicion . The chaplain petrified . “ What plum tomato , Chaplain ? ” Colonel Korn demanded roughly . The chaplain looked arm surprise plum tomato Colonel Cathcart invited take . “ I got Colonel Cathcart ’ office , sir , ” managed reply . “ Does colonel know took ? ” “ Yes , sir . He gave me. ” “ Oh , case I guess ’ okay , ” Colonel Korn said , mollified . He smiled without warmth , jabbing crumpled folds shirt back inside trousers thumbs . His eyes glinted keenly private satisfying mischief . “ What Colonel Cathcart want see , Father ? ” asked suddenly . The chaplain tongue-tied indecision moment . “ I ’ think I ought- “ “ Saying prayers editors The Saturday Evening Post ? ” The chaplain almost smiled . “ Yes , sir. ” Colonel Korn enchanted intuition . He laughed disparagingly . “ You know , I afraid ’ begin thinking something ridiculous soon saw week ’ Saturday Evening Post . I hope succeeded showing atrocious idea is. ” “ He decided , sir. ” “ That ’ good . I ’ glad convinced editors The Saturday Evening Post likely run story twice give publicity obscure colonel . How things wilderness , Father ? Are able manage ? ” “ Yes , sir . Everything working out. ” “ That ’ good . I ’ happy hear nothing complain . Let us know need anything make comfortable . We want good time there. ” “ Thank , sir . I will. ” Noise growing stir rose lobby . It almost lunchtime , earliest arrivals drifting headquarters mess halls , enlisted men officers separating different dining halls facing sides archaic rotunda . Colonel Korn stopped smiling . “ You lunch us day ago , ’ , Father ? ” asked meaningfully . “ Yes , sir . The day yesterday. ” “ That ’ I thought , ” Colonel Korn said , paused let point sink . “ Well , take easy , Father . I ’ see around ’ time eat again. ” “ Thank , sir. ” The chaplain certain five officers ’ five enlisted men ’ mess halls scheduled lunch day , system rotation worked Colonel Korn complicated , forgotten records back tent . The chaplain officer attached Group Headquarters reside moldering red-stone Group Headquarters building smaller satellite structures rose grounds disjuncted relationship . The chaplain lived clearing woods four miles away officers ’ club first four squadron areas stretched away Group Headquarters distant line . The chaplain lived alone spacious , square tent also office . Sounds revelry traveled night officers ’ club kept awake often turned tossed cot passive , half-voluntary exile . He able gauge effect mild pills took occasionally help sleep felt guilty days afterward . The one lived chaplain clearing woods Corporal Whitcomb , assistant . Corporal Whitcomb , atheist , disgruntled subordinate felt could chaplain ’ job much better chaplain viewed , therefore , underprivileged victim social inequity . He lived tent spacious square chaplain ’ . He openly rude contemptuous chaplain discovered chaplain would let get away . The borders two tents clearing stood four five feet apart . It Colonel Korn mapped way life chaplain . One good reason making chaplain live outside Group Headquarters building Colonel Korn ’ theory dwelling tent parishioners would bring closer communication . Another good reason fact chaplain around Headquarters time made officers uncomfortable . It one thing maintain liaison Lord , favor ; something else , though , Him hanging around twenty-four hours day . All , Colonel Korn described Major Danby , jittery goggle-eyed group operations officer , chaplain pretty soft ; little listen troubles others , bury dead , visit bedridden conduct religious services . And many dead bury , Colonel Korn pointed , since opposition German fighter planes virtually ceased since close ninety per cent fatalities still , estimated , perished behind enemy lines disappeared inside clouds , chaplain nothing disposing remains . The religious services certainly great strain , either , since conducted week Group Headquarters building attended men . Actually , chaplain learning love clearing woods . Both Corporal Whitcomb provided every convenience neither might ever plead discomfort basis seeking permission return Headquarters building . The chaplain rotated breakfasts , lunches dinners separate sets among eight squadron mess halls ate every fifth meal enlisted men ’ mess Group Headquarters every tenth meal officers ’ mess . Back home Wisconsin chaplain fond gardening , heart welled glorious impression fertility fruition time contemplated low , prickly boughs stunted trees waist-high weeds thickets almost walled . In spring longed plant begonias zinnias narrow bed around tent deterred fear Corporal Whitcomb ’ rancor . The chaplain relished privacy isolation verdant surroundings reverie meditation living fostered . Fewer people came troubles formerly , allowed measure gratitude . The chaplain mix freely comfortable conversation . He missed wife three small children , missed . What displeased Corporal Whitcomb chaplain , apart fact chaplain believed God , lack initiative aggressiveness . Corporal Whitcomb regarded low attendance religious services sad reflection status . His mind germinated feverishly challenging new ideas sparking great spiritual revival dreamed architect-box lunches , church socials , form letters families men killed injured combat , censorship , Bingo . But chaplain blocked . Corporal Whitcomb bridled vexation beneath chaplain ’ restraint , spied room improvement everywhere . It people like chaplain , concluded , responsible giving religion bad name making pariahs . Unlike chaplain , Corporal Whitcomb detested seclusion clearing woods . One first things intended deposed chaplain move back Group Headquarters building , could right thick things . When chaplain drove back clearing leaving Colonel Korn , Corporal Whitcomb outside muggy haze talking conspiratorial tones strange chubby man maroon corduroy bathrobe gray flannel pajamas . The chaplain recognized bathrobe pajamas official hospital attire . Neither two men gave sign recognition . The stranger ’ gums painted purple ; corduroy bathrobe decorated back picture B-25 nosing orange bursts flak front six neat rows tiny bombs signifying sixty combat missions flown . The chaplain struck sight stopped stare . Both men broke conversation waited stony silence go . The chaplain hurried inside tent . He heard , imagined heard , tittering . Corporal Whitcomb walked moment later demanded , “ What ’ ? ” “ There ’ anything new , ” chaplain replied averted eyes . “ Was anyone see ? ” “ Just crackpot Yossarian . He ’ real troublemaker , ’ ? ” “ I ’ sure ’ crackpot , ” chaplain observed . “ That ’ right , take part , ” said Corporal Whitcomb injured tone , stamped . The chaplain could believe Corporal Whitcomb offended really walked . As soon realize , Corporal Whitcomb walked back . “ You always side people , ” Corporal Whitcomb accused . “ You ’ back men . That ’ one things ’ wrong you. ” “ I ’ intend side , ” chaplain apologized . “ I making statement. ” “ What Colonel Cathcart want ? ” “ It ’ anything important . He wanted discuss possibility saying prayers briefing room mission. ” “ All right , ’ tell , ” Corporal Whitcomb snapped walked . The chaplain felt terrible . No matter considerate tried , seemed always managed hurt Corporal Whitcomb ’ feelings . He gazed remorsefully saw orderly forced upon Colonel Korn keep tent clean attend belongings neglected shine shoes . Corporal Whitcomb came back . “ You never trust information , ” whined truculently . “ You ’ confidence men . That ’ another one things ’ wrong you. ” “ Yes , I , ” chaplain assured guiltily . “ I lots confidence you. ” “ Then letters ? ” “ No , , ” chaplain pleaded , cringing . “ Not letters . Please ’ bring . I ’ let know I change mind. ” Corporal Whitcomb looked furious . “ Is ? Well , ’ right sit shake head I work . Didn ’ see guy outside pictures painted bathrobe ? ” “ Is see ? ” “ No , ” Corporal Whitcomb said , walked . It hot humid inside tent , chaplain felt turning damp . He listened like unwilling eavesdropper muffled , indistinguishable drone lowered voices outside . As sat inertly rickety bridge table served desk , lips closed , eyes blank , face , pale ochre hue ancient , confined clusters minute acne pits , color texture uncracked almond shell . He racked memory clue origin Corporal Whitcomb ’ bitterness toward . In way unable fathom , convinced done unforgivable wrong . It seemed incredible lasting ire Corporal Whitcomb ’ could stemmed rejection Bingo form letters home families men killed combat . The chaplain despondent acceptance ineptitude . He intended weeks heart-to-heart talk Corporal Whitcomb order find bothering , already ashamed might find . Outside tent , Corporal Whitcomb snickered . The man chuckled . For precarious seconds , chaplain tingled weird , occult sensation experienced identical situation prior time existence . He endeavored trap nourish impression order predict , perhaps even control , incident would occur next , afatus melted away unproductively , known beforehand would . Déjà vu . The subtle , recurring confusion illusion reality characteristic paramnesia fascinated chaplain , knew number things . He knew , example , called paramnesia , interested well corollary optical phenomena jamais vu , never seen , presque vu , almost seen . There terrifying , sudden moments objects , concepts even people chaplain lived almost life inexplicably took unfamiliar irregular aspect never seen made totally strange : jamais vu . And moments almost saw absolute truth brilliant flashes clarity almost came : presque vu . The episode naked man tree Snowden ’ funeral mystified thoroughly . It déjà vu , time experienced sensation ever seen naked man tree Snowden ’ funeral . It jamais vu , since apparition someone , something , familiar appearing unfamiliar guise . And certainly presque vu , chaplain see . A jeep started backfire directly outside roared away . Had naked man tree Snowden ’ funeral merely hallucination ? Or true revelation ? The chaplain trembled mere idea . He wanted desperately confide Yossarian , time thought occurrence decided think , although think could sure ever really thought . Corporal Whitcomb sauntered back wearing shiny new smirk leaned elbow impertinently center pole chaplain ’ tent . “ Do know guy red bathrobe ? ” asked boastfully . “ That C.I.D . man fractured nose . He came hospital official business . He ’ conducting investigation. ” The chaplain raised eyes quickly obsequious commiseration . “ I hope ’ trouble . Is anything I ? ” “ No , I ’ trouble , ” Corporal Whitcomb replied grin . “ You . They ’ going crack signing Washington Irving ’ name letters ’ signing Washington Irving ’ name . How like ? ” “ I ’ signing Washington Irving ’ name letters , ” said chaplain . “ You ’ lie , ” Corporal Whitcomb answered . “ I ’ one convince. ” “ But I ’ lying. ” “ I ’ care whether ’ lying . They ’ going get intercepting Major Major ’ correspondence , . A lot stuff classified information. ” “ What correspondence ? ” asked chaplain plaintively rising exasperation . “ I ’ never even seen Major Major ’ correspondence. ” “ You ’ lie , ” Corporal Whitcomb replied . “ I ’ one convince. ” “ But I ’ lying ! ” protested chaplain . “ I ’ see shout , ” Corporal Whitcomb retorted injured look . He came away center pole shook finger chaplain emphasis . “ I biggest favor anybody ever whole life , ’ even realize . Every time tries report superiors , somebody hospital censors details . He ’ going batty weeks trying turn . I put censor ’ okay letter without even reading . That make good impression C.I.D . headquarters . It let know ’ least bit afraid whole truth come out. ” The chaplain reeling confusion . “ But ’ authorized censor letters , ? ” “ Of course , ” Corporal Whitcomb answered . “ Only officers ever authorized . I censored name. ” “ But I ’ authorized censor letters either . Am I ? ” “ I took care , , ” Corporal Whitcomb assured . “ I signed somebody else ’ name you. ” “ Isn ’ forgery ? ” “ Oh , ’ worry either . The one might complain case forgery person whose name forged , I looked interests picking dead man . I used Washington Irving ’ name. ” Corporal Whitcomb scrutinized chaplain ’ face closely sign rebellion breezed ahead confidently concealed irony . “ That pretty quick thinking part , ’ ? ” “ I ’ know , ” chaplain wailed softly quavering voice , squinting grotesque contortions anguish incomprehension . “ I ’ think I understand ’ telling . How make good impression signed Washington Irving ’ name instead ? ” “ Because ’ convinced Washington Irving . Don ’ see ? They ’ know you. ” “ But ’ belief want dispel ? Won ’ help prove ? ” “ If I thought going stuffy , I ’ even tried help , ” Corporal Whitcomb declared indignantly , walked . A second later walked back . “ I biggest favor anybody ever whole life ’ even know . You ’ know show appreciation . That ’ another one things ’ wrong you. ” “ I ’ sorry , ” chaplain apologized contritely . “ I really sorry . It ’ I ’ completely stunned ’ telling I ’ even realize I ’ saying . I ’ really grateful you. ” “ Then letting send form letters ? ” Corporal Whitcomb demanded immediately . “ Can I begin working first drafts ? ” The chaplain ’ jaw dropped astonishment . “ No , , ” groaned . “ Not now. ” Corporal Whitcomb incensed . “ I ’ best friend ’ got ’ even know , ” asserted belligerently , walked chaplain ’ tent . He walked back . “ I ’ side ’ even realize . Don ’ know serious trouble ’ ? That C.I.D . man gone rushing back hospital write brand-new report tomato. ” “ What tomato ? ” chaplain asked , blinking . “ The plum tomato hiding hand first showed . There . The tomato ’ still holding hand right minute ! ” The captain unclenched fingers surprise saw still holding plum tomato obtained Colonel Cathcart ’ office . He set quickly bridge table . “ I got tomato Colonel Cathcart , ” said , struck ludicrous explanation sounded . “ He insisted I take it. ” “ You ’ lie , ” Corporal Whitcomb answered . “ I ’ care whether stole not. ” “ Stole ? ” chaplain exclaimed amazement . “ Why I want steal plum tomato ? ” “ That ’ exactly us stumped , ” said Corporal Whitcomb . “ And C.I.D . man figured might important secret papers hidden away inside it. ” The chaplain sagged limply beneath mountainous weight despair . “ I ’ important secret papers hidden away inside , ” stated simply . “ I ’ even want begin . Here , see yourself. ” “ I ’ want it. ” “ Please take away , ” chaplain pleaded voice barely audible . “ I want rid it. ” “ I ’ want , ” Corporal Whitcomb snapped , stalked angry face , suppressing smile great jubilation forged powerful new alliance C.I.D . man succeeded convincing chaplain really displeased . Poor Whitcomb , sighed chaplain , blamed assistant ’ malaise . He sat mutely ponderous , stultifying melancholy , waiting expectantly Corporal Whitcomb walk back . He disappointed heard peremptory crunch Corporal Whitcomb ’ footsteps recede silence . There nothing wanted next . He decided pass lunch Milky Way Baby Ruth foot locker swallows luke-warm water canteen . He felt surrounded dense , overwhelming fogs possibilities could perceive glimmer light . He dreaded Colonel Cathcart would think news suspected Washington Irving brought , fell fretting Colonel Cathcart already thinking even broached subject sixty missions . There much unhappiness world , reflected , bowing head dismally beneath tragic thought , nothing could anybody ’ , least . 21 GENERAL DREEDLE Colonel Cathcart thinking anything chaplain , tangled brand-new , menacing problem : Yossarian ! Yossarian ! The mere sound execrable , ugly name made blood run cold breath come labored gasps . The chaplain ’ first mention name Yossarian ! tolled deep memory like portentous gong . As soon latch door clicked shut , whole humiliating recollection naked man formation came cascading upon mortifying , choking flood stinging details . He began perspire tremble . There sinister unlikely coincidence exposed diabolical implication anything less hideous omens . The name man stood naked ranks day receive Distinguished Flying Cross General Dreedle also been-Yossarian ! And man named Yossarian threatening make trouble sixty missions ordered men group fly . Colonel Cathcart wondered gloomily Yossarian . He climbed feet air intolerable woe began moving office . He felt presence mysterious . The naked man formation , conceded cheerlessly , real black eye . So tampering bomb line mission Bologna seven-day delay destroying bridge Ferrara , even though destroying bridge Ferrara finally , remembered glee , real feather cap , although losing plane second time around , recalled dejection , another black eye , even though another real feather cap getting medal approved bombardier gotten real black eye first place going around target twice . That bombardier ’ name , remembered suddenly another stupefying shock , also Yossarian ! Now three ! His viscous eyes bulged astonishment whipped around alarm see taking place behind . A moment ago Yossarians life ; multiplying like hobgoblins . He tried make grow calm . Yossarian common name ; perhaps really three Yossarians two Yossarians , maybe even one Yossarian-but really made difference ! The colonel still grave peril . Intuition warned drawing close immense inscrutable cosmic climax , broad , meaty , towering frame tingled head toe thought Yossarian , whoever would eventually turn , destined serve nemesis . Colonel Cathcart superstitious , believe omens , sat right back behind desk made cryptic notation memorandum pad look whole suspicious business Yossarians right away . He wrote reminder heavy decisive hand , amplifying sharply series coded punctuation marks underlining whole message twice , read : Yossarian ! ! ! ( ? ) ! The colonel sat back finished extremely pleased prompt action taken meet sinister crisis . Yossarian-the sight name made shudder . There many esses . It subversive . It like word subversive . It like seditious insidious , like socialist , suspicious , fascist Communist . It odious , alien , distasteful name , inspire confidence . It like clean , crisp , honest , American names Cathcart , Peckem Dreedle . Colonel Cathcart rose slowly began drifting office . Almost unconsciously , picked plum tomato top one bushels took voracious bite . He made wry face threw rest plum tomato waste-basket . The colonel like plum tomatoes , even , even . These purchased different market places Pianosa Colonel Korn various identities , moved colonel ’ farmhouse hills dead night , transported Group Headquarters next morning sale Milo , paid Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn premium prices . Colonel Cathcart often wondered plum tomatoes legal , Colonel Korn said , tried brood often . He way knowing whether house hills legal , either , since Colonel Korn made arrangements . Colonel Cathcart know owned house rented , acquired much , anything , costing . Colonel Korn lawyer , Colonel Korn assured fraud , extortion , currency manipulation , embezzlement , income tax evasion black-market speculations legal , Colonel Cathcart position disagree . All Colonel Cathcart knew house hills house hated . He never bored spending two three days every week necessary sustain illusion damp drafty stone farmhouse hills golden palace carnal delights . Officers ’ clubs everywhere pulsated blurred knowing accounts lavish , hushed-up drinking sex orgies secret , intimate nights ecstasy beautiful , tantalizing , readily aroused easily satisfied Italian courtesans , film actresses , models countesses . No private nights ecstasy hushed-up drinking sex orgies ever occurred . They might occurred either General Dreedle General Peckem evinced interest taking part orgies , neither ever , colonel certainly going waste time energy making love beautiful women unless something . The colonel dreaded dank lonely nights farmhouse dull , uneventful days . He much fun back Group , browbeating everyone ’ afraid . However , Colonel Korn kept reminding , much glamour farmhouse hills never used . He drove farmhouse time mood self-pity . He carried shotgun jeep spent monotonous hours shooting birds plum tomatoes grow untended rows much trouble harvest . Among officers inferior rank toward Colonel Cathcart still deemed prudent show respect , included Major -- de Coverley , even though want sure even . Major -- de Coverley great mystery Major Major everyone else ever took notice . Colonel Cathcart idea whether look look attitude toward Major -- de Coverley . Major -- de Coverley major , even though ages older Colonel Cathcart ; time , many people treated Major -- de Coverley profound fearful veneration Colonel Cathcart hunch might know something . Major -- de Coverley ominous , incomprehensible presence kept constantly edge even Colonel Korn tended wary . Everyone afraid , one knew . No one even knew Major -- de Coverley ’ first name , one ever temerity ask . Colonel Cathcart knew Major -- de Coverley away rejoiced absence occurred Major -- de Coverley might away somewhere conspiring , wished Major -- de Coverley back squadron belonged could watched . In little Colonel Cathcart ’ arches began ache pacing back forth much . He sat behind desk resolved embark upon mature systematic evaluation entire military situation . With businesslike air man knows get things done , found large white pad , drew straight line middle crossed near top , dividing page two blank columns equal width . He rested moment critical rumination . Then huddled desk , head left column , cramped finicky hand , wrote , “ Black Eyes ! ! ! ” At top right column wrote , “ Feathers My Cap ! ! ! ! ! ” He leaned back inspect chart admiringly objective perspective . After seconds solemn deliberation , licked tip pencil carefully wrote “ Black Eyes ! ! ! , ” intent intervals : Ferrara Bologna ( bomb line moved map ) Skeet range Naked man information ( Avignon ) Then added : Food poisoning ( Bologna ) Moaning ( epidemic Avignon briefing ) Then added : Chaplain ( hanging around officers ’ club every night ) He decided charitable chaplain , even though like , “ Feathers My Cap ! ! ! ! ! ” wrote : Chaplain ( hanging around officers ’ club every night ) The two chaplain entries , therefore , neutralized . Alongside “ Ferrara ” “ Naked man formation ( Avignon ) ” wrote : Yossarian ! Alongside “ Bologna ( bomb line moved map ) ” “ Food poisoning ( Bologna ) ” “ Moaning ( epidemic Avignon briefing ) ” wrote bold , decisive hand : ? Those entries labeled “ ? ” ones wanted investigate immediately determine Yossarian played part . Suddenly arm began shake , unable write . He rose feet terror , feeling sticky fat , rushed open window gulp fresh air . His gaze fell skeet-range , reeled away sharp cry distress , wild feverish eyes scanning walls office frantically though swarming Yossarians . Nobody loved . General Dreedle hated , although General Peckem liked , although ’ sure , since Colonel Cargill , General Peckem ’ aide , undoubtedly ambitions probably sabotaging General Peckem every opportunity . The good colonel , decided , dead colonel , except . The colonel trusted Colonel Moodus , even father-in-law . Milo , course , big feather cap , although group bombed Milo ’ planes probably terrible black eye , even though Milo ultimately stilled protest disclosing huge net profit syndicate realized deal enemy convincing everyone bombing men planes therefore really commendable lucrative blow side private enterprise . The colonel insecure Milo colonels trying lure away , Colonel Cathcart still lousy Big Chief White Halfoat group lousy , lazy Captain Black claimed one really responsible bomb line ’ moved Big Siege Bologna . Colonel Cathcart liked Big Chief White Halfoat Big Chief White Halfoat kept punching lousy Colonel Moodus nose every time got drunk Colonel Moodus around . He wished Big Chief White Halfoat would begin punching Colonel Korn fat face , . Colonel Korn lousy smart aleck . Someone Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters sent back every report wrote blistering rebuke , Colonel Korn bribed clever mail clerk named Wintergreen try find . Losing plane Ferrara second time around done good , admit , neither plane disappear inside cloud-that one ’ even written ! He tried recall , longingly , Yossarian lost plane cloud realized Yossarian could possibly lost plane cloud still around raising big stink fly lousy five missions . Maybe sixty missions many men fly , Colonel Cathcart reasoned , Yossarian objected flying , remembered forcing men fly missions everyone else tangible achievement going . As Colonel Korn often remarked , war crawling group commanders merely duty , required sort dramatic gesture like making group fly combat missions bomber group spotlight unique qualities leadership . Certainly none generals seemed object , although far could detect ’ particularly impressed either , made suspect perhaps sixty combat missions nearly enough ought increase number seventy , eighty , hundred , even two hundred , three hundred , six thousand ! Certainly would much better somebody suave like General Peckem somebody boorish insensitive like General Dreedle , General Peckem discernment , intelligence Ivy League background appreciate enjoy full value , although General Peckem never given slightest indication appreciated enjoyed . Colonel Cathcart felt perceptive enough realize visible signals recognition never necessary sophisticated , self-assured people like General Peckem could warm distance innate mutual understanding . It enough like kind , knew matter waiting discreetly preferment right time , although rotted Colonel Cathcart ’ self-esteem observe General Peckem never deliberately sought labored harder impress Colonel Cathcart epigrams erudition impress anyone else earshot , even enlisted men . Either Colonel Cathcart ’ getting General Peckem General Peckem scintillating , discriminating , intellectual , forward-looking personality pretended really General Dreedle sensitive , charming , brilliant sophisticated would certainly much better , suddenly Colonel Cathcart absolutely conception strongly stood anyone began banging buzzer fist Colonel Korn come running office assure everybody loved , Yossarian figment imagination , making wonderful progress splendid valiant campaign waging become general . Actually , Colonel Cathcart chance hell becoming general . For one thing , ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , also wanted general always distorted , destroyed , rejected misdirected correspondence , Colonel Cathcart might credit . For another , already general , General Dreedle knew General Peckem job know stop . General Dreedle , wing commander , blunt , chunky , barrel-chested man early fifties . His nose squat red , lumpy white , bunched-up eyelids circling small gray eyes like haloes bacon fat . He nurse son-in law , prone long , ponderous silences drinking much . General Dreedle wasted much time Army job well , late . New power alignments coalesced without loss cope . At unguarded moments hard sullen face slipped somber , preoccupied look defeat frustration . General Dreedle drank great deal . His moods arbitrary unpredictable . “ War hell , ” declared frequently , drunk sober , really meant , although prevent making good living taking son-in-law business , even though two bickered constantly . “ That bastard , ” General Dreedle would complain son-in-law contemptuous grunt anyone happened standing beside curve bar officers ’ club . “ Everything ’ got owes . I made , lousy son bitch ! He ’ got brains enough get ahead own. ” “ He thinks knows everything , ” Colonel Moodus would retort sulking tone audience end bar . “ He ’ take criticism ’ listen advice. ” “ All give advice , ” General Dreedle would observe rasping snort . “ If ’ , ’ still corporal. ” General Dreedle always accompanied Colonel Moodus nurse , delectable piece ass anyone saw ever laid eyes . General Dreedle ’ nurse chubby , short blonde . She plump dimpled cheeks , happy blue eyes , neat curly turned-up hair . She smiled everyone never spoke unless spoken . Her bosom lush complexion clear . She irresistible , men edged away carefully . She succulent , sweet , docile dumb , drove everyone crazy General Dreedle . “ You see naked , ” General Dreedle chortled croupy relish , nurse stood smiling proudly right shoulder . “ Back Wing ’ got uniform room made purple silk ’ tight nipples stand like bing cherries . Milo got fabric . There ’ even room enough panties brassière underneath . I make wear nights Moodus around drive crazy. ” General Dreedle laughed hoarsely . “ You see goes inside blouse every time shifts weight . She drives mind . The first time I catch putting hand woman I ’ bust horny bastard right private put K.P . year. ” “ He keeps around drive crazy , ” Colonel Moodus accused aggrievedly end bar . “ Back Wing ’ got uniform made purple silk ’ tight nipples stand like bing cherries . There ’ even room panties brassière underneath . You hear rustle every time shifts weight . The first time I make pass girl ’ bust right private put K.P . year . She drives mind. ” “ He ’ gotten laid since shipped overseas , ” confided General Dreedle , square grizzled head bobbed sadistic laughter fiendish idea . “ That ’ one reasons I never let sight , ’ get woman . Can imagine poor son bitch going ? ” “ I ’ bed woman since shipped overseas , ” Colonel Moodus whimpered tearfully . “ Can imagine I ’ going ? ” General Dreedle could intransigent anyone else displeased Colonel Moodus . He taste sham , tact pretension , credo professional soldier unified concise : believed young men took orders willing give lives ideals , aspirations idiosyncrasies old men took orders . The officers enlisted men command identity military quantities . All asked work ; beyond , free whatever pleased . They free , Colonel Cathcart free , force men fly sixty missions chose , free , Yossarian free , stand formation naked wanted , although General Dreedle ’ granite jaw swung open sight went striding dictatorially right line make certain really man wearing nothing moccasins waiting attention ranks receive medal . General Dreedle speechless . Colonel Cathcart began faint spied Yossarian , Colonel Korn stepped behind squeezed arm strong grip . The silence grotesque . A steady warm wind flowed beach , old cart filled dirty straw rumbled view main road , drawn black donkey driven farmer flopping hat faded brown work clothes paid attention formal military ceremony taking place small field right . At last General Dreedle spoke . “ Get back car , ” snapped shoulder nurse , followed line . The nurse toddled away smile toward brown staff car , parked twenty yards away edge rectangular clearing . General Dreedle waited austere silence car door slammed demanded , “ Which one ? ” Colonel Moodus checked roster . “ This one Yossarian , Dad . He gets Distinguished Flying Cross. ” “ Well , I ’ damned , ” mumbled General Dreedle , ruddy monolithic face softened amusement . “ Why ’ wearing clothes , Yossarian ? ” “ I ’ want to. ” “ What mean ’ want ? Why hell ’ want ? ” “ I ’ want , sir. ” “ Why ’ wearing clothes ? ” General Dreedle demanded shoulder Colonel Cathcart . “ He ’ talking , ” Colonel Korn whispered Colonel Cathcart ’ shoulder behind , jabbing elbow sharply Colonel Cathcart ’ back . “ Why ’ wearing clothes ? ” Colonel Cathcart demanded Colonel Korn look acute pain , tenderly nursing spot Colonel Korn jabbed . “ Why ’ wearing clothes ? ” Colonel Korn demanded Captain Piltchard Captain Wren . “ A man killed plane Avignon last week bled , ” Captain Wren replied . “ He swears ’ never going wear uniform again. ” “ A man killed plane Avignon last week bled , ” Colonel Korn reported directly General Dreedle . “ His uniform ’ come back laundry yet. ” “ Where uniforms ? ” “ They ’ laundry , too. ” “ What underwear ? ” General Dreedle demanded . “ All underwear ’ laundry , , ” answered Colonel Korn . “ That sounds like lot crap , ” General Dreedle declared . “ It lot crap , sir , ” Yossarian said . “ Don ’ worry , sir , ” Colonel Cathcart promised General Dreedle threatening look Yossarian . “ You personal word man severely punished. ” “ What hell I care ’ punished ? ” General Dreedle replied surprise irritation . “ He ’ medal . If wants receive without clothes , hell business ? ” “ Those sentiments exactly , sir ! ” Colonel Cathcart echoed resounding enthusiasm mopped brow damp white handkerchief . “ But would say , sir , even light General Peckem ’ recent memorandum subject appropriate military attire combat areas ? ” “ Peckem ? ” General Dreedle ’ face clouded . “ Yes , sir , sir , ” said Colonel Cathcart obsequiously . “ General Peckem even recommends send men combat full-dress uniform ’ make good impression enemy ’ shot down. ” “ Peckem ? ” repeated General Dreedle , still squinting bewilderment . “ Just hell Peckem ? ” Colonel Korn jabbed Colonel Cathcart sharply back elbow . “ Absolutely nothing , sir ! ” Colonel Cathcart responded sprucely , wincing extreme pain gingerly rubbing spot Colonel Korn jabbed . “ And ’ exactly I decided take absolutely action I first opportunity discuss . Shall ignore completely , sir ? ” General Dreedle ignored completely , turning away baleful scorn hand Yossarian medal case . “ Get girl back car , ” commanded Colonel Moodus crabbily , waited one spot scowling face nurse rejoined . “ Get word office right away kill directive I issued ordering men wear neckties combat missions , ” Colonel Cathcart whispered Colonel Korn urgently corner mouth . “ I told , ” Colonel Korn snickered . “ But ’ listen me. ” “ Shhhh ! ” Colonel Cathcart cautioned . “ Goddammit , Korn , back ? ” Colonel Korn snickered . General Dreedle ’ nurse always followed General Dreedle everywhere went , even briefing room mission Avignon , stood asinine smile side platform bloomed like fertile oasis General Dreedle ’ shoulder pink-and-green uniform . Yossarian looked fell love , desperately . His spirits sank , leaving empty inside numb .

A wave startled uneasiness broke officers dais , even Major Danby , begun synchronizing watches , distracted momentarily counted seconds almost begin . Nately followed Yossarian ’ transfixed gaze long frame auditorium came General Dreedle ’ nurse . He blanched trepidation guessed troubling Yossarian . “ Cut , ? ” Nately warned fierce whisper . “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Yossarian moaned fourth time , time loudly enough everyone hear distinctly . “ Are crazy ? ” Nately hissed vehemently . “ You ’ get trouble. ” “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Dunbar answered Yossarian opposite end room .

Can ’ see upset I already cotton piling piers Egypt ? ” Milo ’ voice splintered fragments , clutched Yossarian ’ shirt front though drowning . His eyes throbbing visibly like brown caterpillars . “ Yossarian , I going much cotton ? It ’ fault letting buy it. ” The cotton piling piers Egypt , nobody wanted . Milo never dreamed Nile Valley could fertile would market crop bought . The mess halls syndicate would help ; rose uncompromising rebellion proposal tax per capita basis order enable man share Egyptian cotton crop . Even reliable friends Germans failed crisis : preferred ersatz . Milo ’ mess halls would even help store cotton , warehousing costs skyrocketed contributed devastating drain upon cash reserves . The profits Orvieto mission sucked away . He began writing home money sent back better days ; soon almost gone . And new bales cotton kept arriving wharves Alexandria every day . Each time succeeded dumping world market loss snapped canny Egyptian brokers Levant , sold back original price , really worse . M amp ; M Enterprises verged collapse . Milo cursed hourly monumental greed stupidity purchasing entire Egyptian cotton crop , contract contract honored , one night , sumptuous evening meal , Milo ’ fighters bombers took , joined formation directly overhead began dropping bombs group . He landed another contract Germans , time bomb outfit . Milo ’ planes separated well co-ordinated attack bombed fuel stocks ordnance dump , repair hangars B-25 bombers resting lollipop-shaped hardstands field . His crews spared landing strip mess halls could land safely work done enjoy hot snack retiring . They bombed landing lights , since one shooting back . They bombed four squadrons , officers ’ club Group Headquarters building . Men bolted tents sheer terror know direction turn . Wounded soon lay screaming everywhere . A cluster fragmentation bombs exploded yard officers ’ club punched jagged holes side wooden building bellies backs row lieutenants captains standing bar . They doubled agony dropped . The rest officers fled toward two exits panic jammed doorways like dense , howling dam human flesh shrank going farther . Colonel Cathcart clawed elbowed way unruly , bewildered mass stood outside . He stared sky stark astonishment horror . Milo ’ planes , ballooning serenely blossoming treetops bomb bay doors open wing flaps monstrous , bug-eyed , blinding , fiercely flickering , eerie landing lights , apocalyptic sight ever beheld . Colonel Cathcart let go stricken gasp dismay hurled headlong jeep , almost sobbing . He found gas pedal ignition sped toward airfield fast rocking car would carry , huge flabby hands clenched bloodless wheel blaring horn tormentedly . Once almost killed swerved banshee screech tires avoid plowing bunch men running crazily toward hills underwear stunned faces thin arms pressed high around temples puny shields . Yellow , orange red fires burning sides road . Tents trees flames , Milo ’ planes kept coming around interminably blinking white landing lights bomb bay doors open . Colonel Cathcart almost turned jeep slammed brakes control tower . He leaped car still skidding dangerously hurtled flight steps inside , three men busy instruments controls . He bowled two aside lunge nickel-plated microphone , eyes glittering wildly beefy face contorted stress . He squeezed microphone bestial grip began shouting hysterically top voice . “ Milo , son bitch ! Are crazy ? What hell ? Come ! Come ! ” “ Stop hollering much , ? ” answered Milo , standing right beside control tower microphone . “ I ’ right here. ” Milo looked reproof turned back work . “ Very good , men , good , ” chanted microphone . “ But I see one supply shed still standing . That never , Purvis-I ’ spoken kind shoddy work . Now , go right back minute try . And time come slowly… slowly . Haste makes waste , Purvis . Haste makes waste . If I ’ told , I must told hundred times . Haste makes waste. ” The loudspeaker overhead began squawking . “ Milo , Alvin Brown . I ’ finished dropping bombs . What I ? ” “ Strafe , ” said Milo . “ Strafe ? ” Alvin Brown shocked . “ We choice , ” Milo informed resignedly . “ It ’ contract. ” “ Oh , okay , , ” Alvin Brown acquiesced . “ In case I ’ strafe. ” This time Milo gone far . Bombing men planes even phlegmatic observer could stomach , looked like end . High-ranking government officials poured investigate . Newspapers inveighed Milo glaring headlines , Congressmen denounced atrocity stentorian wrath clamored punishment . Mothers children service organized militant groups demanded revenge . Not one voice raised defense . Decent people everywhere affronted , Milo washed opened books public disclosed tremendous profit made . He could reimburse government people property destroyed still enough money left continue buying Egyptian cotton . Everybody , course , owned share . And sweetest part whole deal really need reimburse government . “ In democracy , government people , ” Milo explained . “ We ’ people , ’ ? So might well keep money eliminate middleman . Frankly , I ’ like see government get war altogether leave whole field private industry . If pay government everything owe , ’ encouraging government control discouraging individuals bombing men planes . We ’ taking away incentive. ” Milo correct , course , everyone soon agreed embittered misfits like Doc Daneeka , sulked cantankerously muttered offensive insinuations morality whole venture Milo mollified donation , name syndicate , lightweight aluminum collapsible garden chair Doc Daneeka could fold conveniently carry outside tent time Chief White Halfoat came inside tent carry back inside tent time Chief White Halfoat came . Doc Daneeka lost head Milo ’ bombardment ; instead running cover , remained open performed duty , slithering along ground shrapnel , strafing incendiary bombs like furtive , wily lizard casualty casualty , administering tourniquets , morphine , splints sulfanilamide dark doleful visage , never saying one word reading man ’ bluing wound dreadful portent decay . He worked relentlessly exhaustion long night came snife next day sent hurrying querulously medical tent temperature taken Gus Wes obtain mustard plaster vaporizer . Doc Daneeka tended moaning man night glum profound introverted grief showed airfield day Avignon mission Yossarian climbed steps plane naked , state utter shock , Snowden smeared abundantly bare heels toes , knees , arms fingers , pointed inside wordlessly toward young radio-gunner lay freezing death floor beside still younger tail-gunner kept falling back dead faint time opened eyes saw Snowden dying . Doc Daneeka draped blanket around Yossarian ’ shoulders almost tenderly Snowden removed plane carried ambulance stretcher . He led Yossarian toward jeep . McWatt helped , three drove silence squadron medical tent , McWatt Doc Daneeka guided Yossarian inside chair washed Snowden cold wet balls absorbent cotton . Doc Daneeka gave pill shot put sleep twelve hours . When Yossarian woke went see , Doc Daneeka gave another pill shot put sleep another twelve hours . When Yossarian woke went see , Doc Daneeka made ready give another pill shot . “ How long going keep giving pills shots ? ” Yossarian asked . “ Until feel better. ” “ I feel right now. ” Doc Daneeka ’ frail suntanned forehead furrowed surprise . “ Then ’ put clothes ? Why walking around naked ? ” “ I ’ want wear uniform more. ” Doc Daneeka accepted explanation put away hypodermic syringe . “ Are sure feel right ? ” “ I feel fine . I ’ little logy pills shots ’ giving me. ” Yossarian went business clothes rest day still naked late next morning Milo , hunting everywhere else , finally found sitting tree small distance back quaint little military cemetery Snowden buried . Milo dressed customary business attire-olive-drab trousers , fresh olive-drab shirt tie , one silver first lieutenant ’ bar gleaming collar , regulation dress cap stiff leather bill . “ I ’ looking , ” Milo called Yossarian ground reproachfully . “ You looked tree , ” Yossarian answered . “ I ’ morning. ” “ Come taste tell ’ good . It ’ important. ” Yossarian shook head . He sat nude lowest limb tree balanced hands grasping bough directly . He refused budge , Milo choice stretch arms trunk distasteful hug start climbing . He struggled upward clumsily loud grunts wheezes , clothes squashed crooked time pulled high enough hook leg limb pause breath . His dress cap askew danger falling . Milo caught time began slipping . Globules perspiration glistened like transparent pearls around mustache swelled like opaque blisters eyes . Yossarian watched impassively . Cautiously Milo worked around half circle could face Yossarian . He unwrapped tissue paper something soft , round brown handed Yossarian . “ Please taste let know think . I ’ like serve men. ” “ What ? ” asked Yossarian , took big bite . “ Chocolate-covered cotton. ” Yossarian gagged convulsively sprayed big mouthful chocolate-covered cotton right Milo ’ face . “ Here , take back ! ” spouted angrily . “ Jesus Christ ! Have gone crazy ? You ’ even take goddam seeds out. ” “ Give chance , ? ” Milo begged . “ It ’ bad . Is really bad ? ” “ It ’ even worse. ” “ But I ’ got make mess halls feed men. ” “ They ’ never able swallow it. ” “ They ’ got swallow , ” Milo ordained dictatorial grandeur , almost broke neck let go one arm wave righteous finger air . “ Come , ” Yossarian invited . “ You ’ much safer , see everything. ” Gripping bough hands , Milo began inching way limb sideways utmost care apprehension . His face rigid tension , sighed relief found seated securely beside Yossarian . He stroked tree affectionately . “ This pretty good tree , ” observed admiringly proprietary gratitude . “ It ’ tree life , ” Yossarian answered , waggling toes , “ knowledge good evil , too. ” Milo squinted closely bark branches . “ No ’ , ” replied . “ It ’ chestnut tree . I ought know . I sell chestnuts. ” “ Have way. ” They sat tree without talking several seconds , legs dangling hands almost straight bough , one completely nude pair crepe-soled sandals , completely dressed coarse olive-drab woolen uniform tie knotted tight . Milo studied Yossarian diffidently corner eye , hesitating tactfully . “ I want ask something , ” said last . “ You ’ clothes . I ’ want butt anything , I want know . Why ’ wearing uniform ? ” “ I ’ want to. ” Milo nodded rapidly like sparrow pecking . “ I see , I see , ” stated quickly look vivid confusion . “ I understand perfectly . I heard Appleby Captain Black say gone crazy , I wanted find out. ” He hesitated politely , weighing next question . “ Aren ’ ever going put uniform ? ” “ I ’ think so. ” Milo nodded spurious vim indicate still understood sat silent , ruminating gravely troubled misgiving . A scarlet-crested bird shot , brushing sure dark wings quivering bush . Yossarian Milo covered bower tissue-thin tiers sloping green largely surrounded gray chestnut trees silver spruce . The sun high overhead vast sapphire-blue sky beaded low , isolated , puffy clouds dry immaculate white . There breeze , leaves hung motionless . The shade feathery . Everything peace Milo , straightened suddenly muffled cry began pointing excitedly . “ Look ! ” exclaimed alarm . “ Look ! That ’ funeral going . That looks like cemetery . Isn ’ ? ” Yossarian answered slowly level voice . “ They ’ burying kid got killed plane Avignon day . Snowden. ” “ What happened ? ” Milo asked voice deadened awe . “ He got killed. ” “ That ’ terrible , ” Milo grieved , large brown eyes filled tears . “ That poor kid . It really terrible. ” He bit trembling lip hard , voice rose emotion continued . “ And get even worse mess halls ’ agree buy cotton . Yossarian , ’ matter ? Don ’ realize ’ syndicate ? Don ’ know ’ got share ? ” “ Did dead man tent share ? ” Yossarian demanded caustically . “ Of course , ” Milo assured lavishly . “ Everybody squadron share. ” “ He killed even got squadron. ” Milo made deft grimace tribulation turned away . “ I wish ’ stop picking dead man tent , ” pleaded peevishly . “ I told I ’ anything killing . Is fault I saw great opportunity corner market Egyptian cotton got us trouble ? Was I supposed know going glut ? I ’ even know glut days . An opportunity corner market ’ come along often , I pretty shrewd grab chance I it. ” Milo gulped back moan saw six uniformed pallbearers lift plain pine coffin ambulance set gently ground beside yawning gash freshly dug grave . “ And I ’ get rid single penny ’ worth , ” mourned . Yossarian unmoved fustian charade burial ceremony , Milo ’ crushing bereavement . The chaplain ’ voice floated distance tenuously unintelligible , almost inaudible monotone , like gaseous murmur . Yossarian could make Major Major towering lanky aloofness thought recognized Major Danby mopping brow handkerchief . Major Danby stopped shaking since run-in General Dreedle . There strands enlisted men molded curve around three officers , inflexible lumps wood , four idle gravediggers streaked fatigues lounging indifferently spades near shocking , incongruous heap loose copperred earth . As Yossarian stared , chaplain elevated gaze toward Yossarian beatifically , pressed fingers eyeballs manner affliction , peered upward toward Yossarian searchingly , bowed head , concluding Yossarian took climactic part funeral rite . The four men fatigues lifted coffin slings lowered grave . Milo shuddered violently . “ I ’ watch , ” cried , turning away anguish . “ I ’ sit watch mess halls let syndicate die. ” He gnashed teeth shook head bitter woe resentment . “ If loyalty , would buy cotton till hurts keep right buying cotton till hurts . They would build fires burn underwear summer uniforms create bigger demand . But ’ thing . Yossarian , try eating rest chocolate-covered cotton . Maybe taste delicious now. ” Yossarian pushed hand away . “ Give , Milo . People ’ eat cotton. ” Milo ’ face narrowed cunningly . “ It ’ really cotton , ” coaxed . “ I joking . It ’ really cotton candy , delicious cotton candy . Try see. ” “ Now ’ lying. ” “ I never lie ! ” Milo rejoindered proud dignity . “ You ’ lying now. ” “ I lie ’ necessary , ” Milo explained defensively , averting eyes moment blinking lashes winningly . “ This stuff better cotton candy , really . It ’ made real cotton . Yossarian , ’ got help make men eat . Egyptian cotton finest cotton world. ” “ But ’ indigestible , ” Yossarian emphasized . “ It make sick , ’ understand ? Why ’ try living ’ believe ? ” “ I try , ” admitted Milo gloomily . “ And made sick. ” The graveyard yellow hay green cooked cabbage . In little chaplain stepped back , beige crescent human forms began break sluggishly , like flotsam . The men drifted without haste sound vehicles parked along side bumpy dirt road . With heads disconsolately , chaplain , Major Major Major Danby moved toward jeeps ostracized group , holding friendlessly several feet away two . “ It ’ , ” observed Yossarian . “ It ’ end , ” Milo agreed despondently . “ There ’ hope left . And I left free make decisions . That teach lesson discipline next time I try something like this. ” “ Why ’ sell cotton government ? ” Yossarian suggested casually , watched four men streaked fatigues shoveling heaping bladefuls copper-red earth back inside grave . Milo vetoed idea brusquely . “ It ’ matter principle , ” explained firmly . “ The government business business , I would last person world ever try involve government business mine . But business government business , ” remembered alertly , continued elation . “ Calvin Coolidge said , Calvin Coolidge President , must true . And government responsibility buying Egyptian cotton I ’ got one else wants I make profit , ’ ? ” Milo ’ face clouded almost abruptly , spirits descended state sad anxiety . “ But I get government ? ” “ Bribe , ” Yossarian said . “ Bribe ! ” Milo outraged almost lost balance broke neck . “ Shame ! ” scolded severely , breathing virtuous fire upward rusty mustache billowing nostrils prim lips . “ Bribery law , know . But ’ law make profit , ? So ’ law bribe someone order make fair profit , ? No , course ! ” He fell brooding , meek , almost pitiable distress . “ But I know bribe ? ” “ Oh , ’ worry , ” Yossarian comforted toneless snicker engines jeeps ambulance fractured drowsy silence vehicles rear began driving away backward . “ You make bribe big enough ’ find . Just make sure everything right open . Let everyone know exactly want much ’ willing pay . The first time act guilty ashamed , might get trouble. ” “ I wish ’ come , ” Milo remarked . “ I ’ feel safe among people take bribes . They ’ better bunch crooks. ” “ You ’ right , ” Yossarian assured confidence . “ If run trouble , tell everybody security country requires strong domestic Egyptian-cotton speculating industry. ” “ It , ” Milo informed solemnly . “ A strong Egyptian-cotton speculating industry means much stronger America. ” “ Of course . And ’ work , point great number American families depend income. ” “ A great many American families depend income. ” “ You see ? ” said Yossarian . “ You ’ much better I . You almost make sound true. ” “ It true , ” Milo exclaimed strong trace old hauteur . “ That ’ I mean . You right amount conviction. ” “ You ’ sure ’ come ? ” Yossarian shook head . Milo impatient get started . He stuffed remainder chocolate-covered cotton ball shirt pocket edged way back gingerly along branch smooth gray trunk . He threw arms trunk generous awkward embrace began shinnying , sides leather-soled shoes slipping constantly seemed many times would fall injure . Halfway , changed mind climbed back . Bits tree bark stuck mustache , straining face flushed exertion . “ I wish ’ put uniform instead going around naked way , ” confided pensively climbed back hurried away . “ You might start trend , I ’ never get rid goldarned cotton. ” 25 THE CHAPLAIN It already time since chaplain first begun wondering everything . Was God ? How could sure ? Being Anabaptist minister American Army difficult enough best circumstances ; without dogma , almost intolerable . People loud voices frightened . Brave , aggressive men action like Colonel Cathcart left feeling helpless alone . Wherever went Army , stranger . Enlisted men officers conduct conducted enlisted men officers , even chaplains friendly toward toward . In world success virtue , resigned failure . He painfully aware lacked ecclesiastical aplomb savoir-faire enabled many colleagues faiths sects get ahead . He equipped excel . He thought ugly wanted daily home wife . Actually , chaplain almost good-looking , pleasant , sensitive face pale brittle sandstone . His mind open every subject . Perhaps really Washington Irving , perhaps really signing Washington Irving ’ name letters knew nothing . Such lapses memory uncommon medical annals , knew . There way really knowing anything . He remembered distinctly-or impression remembered distinctly-his feeling met Yossarian somewhere first time met Yossarian lying bed hospital . He remembered experiencing disquieting sensation almost two weeks later Yossarian appeared tent ask taken combat duty . By time , course , chaplain met Yossarian somewhere , odd , unorthodox ward every patient seemed delinquent unfortunate patient covered head toe white bandages plaster found dead one day thermometer mouth . But chaplain ’ impression prior meeting occasion far momentous occult , significant encounter Yossarian remote , submerged perhaps even entirely spiritual epoch made identical , foredooming admission nothing , absolutely nothing , could help . Doubts kind gnawed chaplain ’ lean , suffering frame insatiably . Was single true faith , life death ? How many angels could dance head pin , matters God occupy infinite aeons Creation ? Why necessary put protective seal brow Cain people protect ? Did Adam Eve produce daughters ? These great , complex questions ontology tormented . Yet never seemed nearly crucial question kindness good manners . He pinched perspinngly epistemological dilemma skeptic , unable accept solutions problems unwilling dismiss unsolvable . He never without misery , never without hope . “ Have ever , ” inquired hesitantly Yossarian day tent Yossarian sat holding hands warm bottle Coca-Cola chaplain able solace , “ situation felt , even though knew experiencing first time ? ” Yossarian nodded perfunctorily , chaplain ’ breath quickened anticipation made ready join power Yossarian ’ prodigious effort rip away last voluminous black folds shrouding eternal mysteries existence . “ Do feeling ? ” Yossarian shook head explained déjà vu momentary infinitesimal lag operation two coactive sensory nerve centers commonly functioned simultaneously . The chaplain scarcely heard . He disappointed , inclined believe Yossarian , given sign , secret , enigmatic vision still lacked boldness divulge . There mistaking awesome implications chaplain ’ revelation : either insight divine origin hallucination ; either blessed losing mind . Both prospects filled equal fear depression . It neither déjà vu , presque vu jamais vu . It possible vus never heard one vus would explain succinctly bafing phenomenon witness part ; even possible none thought taken place , really taken place , dealing aberration memory rather perception , never really thought seen , impression thought merely illusion illusion , imagining ever imagined seeing naked man sitting tree cemetery . It obvious chaplain particularly well suited work , often speculated whether might happier serving branch service , private infantry field artillery , perhaps , even paratrooper . He real friends . Before meeting Yossarian , one group felt ease , hardly ease Yossarian , whose frequent rash insubordinate outbursts kept almost constantly edge ambiguous state enjoyable trepidation . The chaplain felt safe officers ’ club Yossarian Dunbar , even Nately McWatt . When sat need sit anyone else ; problem sit solved , protected undesired company fellow officers invariably welcomed excessive cordiality approached waited uncomfortably go away . He made many people uneasy . Everyone always friendly toward , one ever nice ; everyone spoke , one ever said anything . Yossarian Dunbar much relaxed , chaplain hardly uncomfortable . They even defended night Colonel Cathcart tried throw officers ’ club , Yossarian rising truculently intervene Nately shouting , “ Yossarian ! ” restrain . Colonel Cathcart turned white sheet sound Yossarian ’ name , , everyone ’ amazement , retreated horrified disorder bumped General Dreedle , elbowed away annoyance ordered right back order chaplain start coming officers ’ club every night . The chaplain almost much trouble keeping track status officers ’ club remembering ten mess halls group scheduled eat next meal . He would soon remained kicked officers ’ club , pleasure finding new companions . If chaplain go officers ’ club night , place else could go . He would pass time Yossarian ’ Dunbar ’ table shy , reticent smile , seldom speaking unless addressed , glass thick sweet wine almost untasted toyed unfamiliarly tiny corncob pipe affected selfconsciously occasionally stuffed tobacco smoked . He enjoyed listening Nately , whose maudlin , bittersweet lamentations mirrored much romantic desolation never failed evoke resurgent tides longing wife children . The chaplain would encourage Nately nods comprehension assent , amused candor immaturity . Nately glory immodestly girl prostitute , chaplain ’ awareness stemmed mainly Captain Black , never slouched past table without broad wink chaplain tasteless , wounding gibe Nately . The chaplain approve Captain Black found difficult wish evil . No one , even Nately , seemed really appreciate , Chaplain Robert Oliver Shipman , chaplain human , could charming , passionate , pretty wife loved almost insanely three small blue-eyed children strange , forgotten faces would grow someday regard freak might never forgive social embarrassment vocation would cause . Why ’ anybody understand really freak normal , lonely adult trying lead normal , lonely adult life ? If pricked , ’ bleed ? And tickled , ’ laugh ? It seemed never occurred , , eyes , hands , organs , dimensions , senses affections , wounded kind weapons , warmed cooled breezes fed kind food , although , forced concede , different mess hall successive meal . The person seem realize feelings Corporal Whitcomb , managed bruise going head Colonel Cathcart proposal sending form letters condolence home families men killed wounded combat . The chaplain ’ wife one thing world could certain , would sufficient , left live life children . The chaplain ’ wife reserved , diminutive , agreeable woman early thirties , dark attractive , narrow waist , calm intelligent eyes , small , bright , pointy teeth childlike face vivacious petite ; kept forgetting children looked like , time returned snapshots like seeing faces first time . The chaplain loved wife children tameless intensity often wanted sink ground helplessly weep like castaway cripple . He tormented inexorably morbid fantasies involving , dire , hideous omens illness accident . His meditations polluted threats dread diseases like Ewing ’ tumor leukemia ; saw infant son die two three times every week never taught wife stop arterial bleeding ; watched , tearful , paralyzed silence , whole family electrocuted , one , baseboard socket never told human body would conduct electricity ; four went flames almost every night water heater exploded set two-story wooden house afire ; ghastly , heartless , revolting detail saw poor dear wife ’ trim fragile body crushed viscous pulp brick wall market building half-wined drunken automobile driver watched hysterical five-year-old daughter led away grisly scene kindly middle-aged gentleman snow-white hair raped murdered repeatedly soon driven deserted sandpit , two younger children starved death slowly house wife ’ mother , baby-sitting , dropped dead heart attack news wife ’ accident given telephone . The chaplain ’ wife sweet , soothing , considerate woman , yearned touch warm flesh slender arm stroke smooth black hair , hear intimate , comforting voice . She much stronger person . He wrote brief , untroubled letters week , sometimes twice . He wanted write urgent love letters day long crowd endless pages desperate , uninhibited confessions humble worship need careful instructions administering artificial respiration . He wanted pour torrents self-pity unbearable loneliness despair warn never leave boric acid aspirin reach children cross street traffic light . He wish worry . The chaplain ’ wife intuitive , gentle , compassionate responsive . Almost inevitably , reveries reunion ended explicit acts love-making . The chaplain felt deceitful presiding funerals , would astonished learn apparition tree day manifestation Almighty ’ censure blasphemy pride inherent function . To simulate gravity , feign grief pretend supernatural intelligence hereafter fearsome arcane circumstance death seemed criminal offenses . He recalled-or almost convinced recalled-the scene cemetery perfectly . He could still see Major Major Major Danby standing somber broken stone pillars either side , see almost exact number enlisted men almost exact places stood , see four unmoving men spades , repulsive coffin large , loose , triumphant mound reddish-brown earth , massive , still , depthless , muffling sky , weirdly blank blue day almost poisonous . He would remember forever , part parcel extraordinary event ever befallen , event perhaps marvelous , perhaps pathological-the vision naked man tree . How could explain ? It already seen never seen , certainly almost seen ; neither déjà vu , jamais vu presque vu elastic enough cover . Was ghost , ? The dead man ’ soul ? An angel heaven minion hell ? Or whole fantastic episode merely figment diseased imagination , , deteriorating mind , rotting brain ? The possibility really naked man tree-two men , actually , since first joined shortly second man clad brown mustache sinister dark garments head toe bent forward ritualistically along limb tree offer first man something drink brown goblet-never crossed chaplain ’ mind . The chaplain sincerely helpful person never able help anyone , even Yossarian finally decided seize bull horns visit Major Major secretly learn , Yossarian said , men Colonel Cathcart ’ group really forced fly combat missions anyone else . It daring , impulsive move chaplain decided quarreling Corporal Whitcomb washing tepid canteen water joyless lunch Milky Way Baby Ruth . He went Major Major foot Corporal Whitcomb would see leaving , stealing forest noiselessly two tents clearing left behind , dropping inside abandoned railroad ditch , footing surer . He hurried along fossilized wooden ties accumulating mutinous anger . He browbeaten humiliated successively morning Colonel Cathcart , Colonel Korn Corporal Whitcomb . He make felt respect ! His slight chest soon puffing breath . He moved swiftly could without breaking run , fearing resolution might dissolve slowed . Soon saw uniformed figure coming toward rusted rails . He clambered immediately side ditch , ducked inside dense copse low trees concealment sped along original direction narrow , overgrown mossy path found winding deep inside shaded forest . It tougher going , plunged ahead reckless consuming determination , slipping stumbling often stinging unprotected hands stubborn branches blocking way bushes tall ferns sides spread open lurched past olive-drab military trailer cinder blocks clearly visible thinning underbrush . He continued past tent luminous pearl-gray cat sunning outside past another trailer cinder blocks burst clearing Yossarian ’ squadron . A salty dew formed lips . He pause , strode directly across clearing orderly room , welcomed gaunt , stoop-shouldered staff sergeant prominent cheekbones long , light blond hair , informed graciously could go right , since Major Major . The chaplain thanked curt nod proceeded alone aisle desks typewriters canvas partition rear . He bobbed triangular opening found inside empty office . The flap fell closed behind . He breathing hard sweating profusely . The office remained empty . He thought heard furtive whispering . Ten minutes passed . He looked stern displeasure , jaws clamped together indomitably , turned suddenly water remembered staff sergeant ’ exact words : could go right , since Major Major . The enlisted men playing practical joke ! The chaplain shrank back wall terror , bitter tears springing eyes . A pleading whimper escaped trembling lips . Major Major elsewhere , enlisted men room made butt inhuman prank . He could almost see waiting side canvas wall , bunched expectantly like pack greedy , gloating omnivorous beasts prey , ready barbaric mirth jeers pounce brutally moment reappeared . He cursed gullibility wished panic something like mask pair dark glasses false mustache disguise , forceful , deep voice like Colonel Cathcart ’ broad , muscular shoulders biceps enable step outside fearlessly vanquish malevolent persecutors overbearing authority self-confidence would make quail slink away cravenly repentance . He lacked courage face . The way window . The coast clear , chaplain jumped Major Major ’ office window , darted swiftly around corner tent , leaped inside railroad ditch hide . He scooted away body doubled face contorted intentionally nonchalant , sociable smile case anyone chanced see . He abandoned ditch forest moment saw someone coming toward opposite direction ran cluttered forest frenziedly like someone pursued , cheeks burning disgrace . He heard loud , wild peals derisive laughter crashing caught blurred glimpses wicked , beery faces smirking far back inside bushes high overhead foliage trees . Spasms scorching pains stabbed lungs slowed crippled walk . He lunged staggered onward could go farther collapsed gnarled apple tree , banging head hard trunk toppled forward holding arms keep falling . His breathing rasping , moaning din ears . Minutes passed like hours finally recognized source turbulent roar overwhelming . The pains chest abated . Soon felt strong enough stand . He cocked ears craftily . The forest quiet . There demonic laughter , one chasing . He tired sad dirty feel relieved . He straightened disheveled clothing fingers numb shaking walked rest way clearing rigid self-control . The chaplain brooded often danger heart attack . Corporal Whitcomb ’ jeep still parked clearing . The chaplain tiptoed stealthily around back Corporal Whitcomb ’ tent rather pass entrance risk seen insulted . Heaving grateful sigh , slipped quickly inside tent found Corporal Whitcomb ensconced cot , knees propped . Corporal Whitcomb ’ mud-caked shoes chaplain ’ blanket , eating one chaplain ’ candy bars thumbed sneering expression one chaplain ’ Bibles . “ Where ’ ? ” demanded rudely disinterestedly , without looking . The chaplain colored turned away evasively . “ I went walk woods. ” “ All right , ” Corporal Whitcomb snapped . “ Don ’ take confidence . But wait see happens morale. ” He bit chaplain ’ candy bar hungrily continued full mouth . “ You visitor gone . Major Major. ” The chaplain spun around surprise cried : “ Major Major ? Major Major ? ” “ That ’ ’ talking , ’ ? ” “ Where go ? ” “ He jumped railroad ditch took like frightened rabbit. ” Corporal Whitcomb snickered . “ What jerk ! ” “ Did say wanted ? ” “ He said needed help matter great importance. ” The chaplain astounded . “ Major Major said ? ” “ He ’ say , ” Corporal Whitcomb corrected withering precision . “ He wrote sealed personal letter left desk. ” The chaplain glanced bridge table served desk saw abominable orange-red pear-shaped plum tomato obtained morning Colonel Cathcart , still lying side forgotten like indestructible incamadine symbol ineptitude . “ Where letter ? ” “ I threw away soon I tore open read it. ” Corporal Whitcomb slammed Bible shut jumped . “ What ’ matter ? Won ’ take word ? ” He walked . He walked right back almost collided chaplain , rushing behind way back Major Major . “ You ’ know delegate responsibility , ” Corporal Whitcomb informed sullenly . “ That ’ another one things ’ wrong you. ” The chaplain nodded penitently hurried past , unable make take time apologize . He could feel skillful hand fate motivating imperatively . Twice day already , realized , Major Major come racing toward inside ditch ; twice day chaplain stupidly postponed destined meeting bolting forest . He seethed self-recrimination hastened back rapidly could stride along splintered , irregularly spaced railroad ties . Bits grit gravel inside shoes socks grinding tops toes raw . His pale , laboring face screwed unconsciously grimace acute discomfort . The early August afternoon growing hotter humid . It almost mile tent Yossarian ’ squadron . The chaplain ’ summer-tan shirt soaking perspiration time arrived rushed breathlessly back inside orderly room tent , halted peremptorily treacherous , soft-spoken staff sergeant round eyeglasses gaunt cheeks , requested remain outside Major Major inside told would allowed inside Major Major went . The chaplain looked uncomprehending daze . Why sergeant hate ? wondered . His lips white trembling . He aching thirst . What matter people ? Wasn ’ tragedy enough ? The sergeant put hand held chaplain steady . “ I ’ sorry , sir , ” said regretfully low , courteous , melancholy voice . “ But Major Major ’ orders . He never wants see anyone. ” “ He wants see , ” chaplain pleaded . “ He came tent see I before. ” “ Major Major ? ” sergeant asked . “ Yes , . Please go ask him. ” “ I ’ afraid I ’ go , sir . He never wants see either . Perhaps left note. ” “ I ’ want leave note . Doesn ’ ever make exception ? ” “ Only extreme circumstances . The last time left tent attend funeral one enlisted men . The last time saw anyone office time forced . A bombardier named Yossarian forced- “ “ Yossarian ? ” The chaplain lit excitement new coincidence . Was another miracle making ? “ But ’ exactly I want speak ! Did talk number missions Yossarian fly ? ” “ Yes , sir , ’ exactly talk . Captain Yossarian flown fifty-one missions , appealed Major Major ground ’ fly four . Colonel Cathcart wanted fifty-five missions then. ” “ And Major Major say ? ” “ Major Major told nothing could do. ” The chaplain ’ face fell . “ Major Major said ? ” “ Yes , sir . In fact , advised Yossarian go see help . Are certain ’ like leave note , sir ? I pencil paper right here. ” The chaplain shook head , chewing clotted dry lower lip forlornly , walked . It still early day , much already happened . The air cooler forest . His throat parched sore . He walked slowly asked ruefully new misfortune could possibly befall moment mad hermit woods leaped without warning behind mulberry bush . The chaplain screamed top voice . The tall , cadaverous stranger fell back fright chaplain ’ cry shrieked , “ Don ’ hurt ! ” “ Who ? ” chaplain shouted . “ Please ’ hurt ! ” man shouted back . “ I ’ chaplain ! ” “ Then want hurt ? ” “ I ’ want hurt ! ” chaplain insisted rising hint exasperation , even though still rooted spot . “ Just tell want me. ” “ I want find Chief White Halfoat died pneumonia yet , ” man shouted back . “ That ’ I want . I live . My name Flume . I belong squadron , I live woods . You ask anyone. ” The chaplain ’ composure began trickling back studied queer , cringing figure intently . A pair captain ’ bars ulcerated rust hung man ’ ragged shirt collar . He hairy , tar-black mole underside one nostril heavy rough mustache color poplar bark . “ Why live woods belong squadron ? ” chaplain inquired curiously . “ I live woods , ” captain replied crabbily , though chaplain ought know . He straightened slowly , still watching chaplain guardedly although towered full head . “ Don ’ hear everybody talking ? Chief White Halfoat swore going cut throat night I fast asleep , I ’ dare lie squadron ’ still alive. ” The chaplain listened implausible explanation distrustfully . “ But ’ incredible , ” replied . “ That would premeditated murder . Why ’ report incident Major Major ? ” “ I report incident Major Major , ” said captain sadly , “ Major Major said would cut throat I ever spoke again. ” The man studied chaplain fearfully . “ Are going cut throat , ? ” “ Oh , , , , ” chaplain assured . “ Of course . Do really live forest ? ” The captain nodded , chaplain gazed porous gray pallor fatigue malnutrition mixture pity esteem . The man ’ body bony shell inside rumpled clothing hung like disorderly collection sacks . Wisps dried grass glued ; needed haircut badly . There great , dark circles eyes . The chaplain moved almost tears harassed , bedraggled picture captain presented , filled deference compassion thought many severe rigors poor man endure daily .

He suspects someone plotting transfer Pacific Ocean . All time ’ thinking coming help . When I told I needed help , wondered ’ chaplain I ’ go see. ” The chaplain waited patient dejection Yossarian Dunbar broke laughter . “ I used think immoral unhappy , ” continued , though keening aloud solitude . “ Now I ’ know think . I ’ like make subject immorality basis sermon Sunday , I ’ sure I ought give sermon purple gums . Colonel Korn displeased them. ” “ Chaplain , ’ come hospital us take easy ? ” Yossarian invited . “ You could comfortable here. ” The brash iniquity proposal tempted amused chaplain second two . “ No , I ’ think , ” decided reluctantly . “ I want arrange trip mainland see mail clerk named Wintergreen .

You probably think ’ good , I arrived puberty late . Well , know ? You ’ frustrated , unhappy , disillusioned , undisciplined , maladjusted young man ! ” Major Sanderson ’ disposition seemed mellow reeled uncomplimentary adjectives . “ Yes , sir , ” Yossarian agreed carefully . “ I guess ’ right. ” “ Of course I ’ right . You ’ immature . You ’ unable adjust idea war. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ You morbid aversion dying . You probably resent fact ’ war might get head blown second. ” “ I resent , sir .

Yossarian enraged ambulance returned squadron , went limping justice Doc Daneeka , glared glumly misery disdain . “ You ! ” Doc Daneeka exclaimed mournfully accusing disgust , egg-shaped pouches eyes firm censorious . “ All ever think . Go take look bomb line want see ’ happening since went hospital. ” Yossarian startled . “ Are losing ? ” “ Losing ? ” Doc Daneeka cried . “ The whole military situation going hell ever since captured Paris . I knew would happen. ” He paused , sulking ire turning melancholy , frowned irritably though Yossarian ’ fault . “ American troops pushing German soil . The Russians captured back Romania . Only yesterday Greeks Eighth Army captured Rimini . The Germans defensive everywhere ! ” Doc Daneeka paused fortified huge breath piercing ejaculation grief . “ There ’ Luftwaffe left ! ” wailed . He seemed ready burst tears . “ The whole Gothic line danger collapsing ! ” “ So ? ” asked Yossarian . “ What ’ wrong ? ” “ What ’ wrong ? ” Doc Daneeka cried . “ If something ’ happen soon , Germany may surrender .

And Yossarian , still walking limp , Yossarian gone two times found menaced rumor another mission Bologna , limped determinedly Dobbs ’ tent early one warm afternoon , put finger mouth said , “ Shush ! ” “ What shushing ? ” asked Kid Sampson , peeling tangerine front teeth perused dog-eared pages comic book . “ He ’ even saying anything. ” “ Screw , ” said Yossarian Kid Sampson , jerking thumb back shoulder toward entrance tent . Kid Sampson cocked blond eyebrows discerningly rose co-operate . He whistled upward four times drooping yellow mustache spurted away hills dented old green motorcycle purchased secondhand months . Yossarian waited last faint bark motor died away distance . Things inside tent seem quite normal . The place neat . Dobbs watching curiously , smoking fat cigar . Now Yossarian made mind brave , deathly afraid . “ All right , ” said . “ Let ’ kill Colonel Cathcart . We ’ together. ” Dobbs sprang forward cot look wildest terror . “ Shush ! ” roared . “ Kill Colonel Cathcart ? What talking ? ” “ Be quiet , damn , ” Yossarian snarled . “ The whole island hear . Have still got gun ? ” “ Are crazy something ? ” shouted Dobbs . “ Why I want kill Colonel Cathcart ? ” “ Why ? ” Yossarian stared Dobbs incredulous scowl . “ Why ? It idea , ’ ? Didn ’ come hospital ask ? ” Dobbs smiled slowly . “ But I fifty-eight missions , ” explained , puffing cigar luxuriously . “ I ’ packed I ’ waiting go home . I ’ finished sixty missions. ” “ So ? ” Yossarian replied . “ He ’ going raise again. ” “ Maybe time ’ t. ” “ He always raises . What hell ’ matter , Dobbs ? Ask Hungry Joe many time ’ packed bags. ” “ I ’ got wait see happens , ” Dobbs maintained stubbornly . “ I ’ crazy get mixed something like I ’ combat. ” He flicked ash cigar . “ No , advice , ” remarked , “ fly sixty missions like rest us see happens. ” Yossarian resisted impulse spit squarely eye . “ I may live sixty , ” wheedled flat , pessimistic voice . “ There ’ rumor around volunteered group Bologna again. ” “ It ’ rumor , ” Dobbs pointed self-important air . “ You ’ believe every rumor hear. ” “ Will stop giving advice ? ” “ Why ’ speak Orr ? ” Dobbs advised . “ Orr got knocked water last week second mission Avignon . Maybe ’ unhappy enough kill him. ” “ Orr ’ got brains enough unhappy. ” Orr knocked water Yossarian still hospital eased crippled airplane gently glassy blue swells Marseilles flawless skill one member six-man crew suffered slightest bruise . The escape hatches front rear sections flew open sea still foaming white green around plane , men scrambled speedily could flaccid orange Mae West life jackets failed inflate dangled limp useless around necks waists . The life jackets failed inflate Milo removed twin carbon-dioxide cylinders inflating chambers make strawberry crushed-pineapple ice-cream sodas served officers ’ mess hall replaced mimeographed notes read : “ What ’ good M amp ; M Enterprises good country. ” Orr popped sinking airplane last . “ You seen ! ” Sergeant Knight roared laughter related episode Yossarian . “ It funniest goddam thing ever saw . None Mae Wests would work Milo stolen carbon dioxide make ice-cream sodas bastards getting officers ’ mess . But ’ bad , turned . Only one us ’ swim , lifted guy raft Orr worked rope right fuselage still standing plane . That little crackpot sure knack things like . Then raft came loose drifted away , six us wound sitting one elbows legs pressed close almost ’ move without knocking guy next raft water . The plane went three seconds left alone , right began unscrewing caps Mae Wests see hell gone wrong found goddam notes Milo telling us good good enough rest us . That bastard !

It sure funny . We kept falling climbing back . We guy ’ swim stretched middle raft floor , even almost drowned , water inside raft deep enough keep splashing face . Oh , boy ! “ Then Orr began opening compartments raft , fun really began . First found box chocolate bars passed around sat eating salty chocolate bars waves kept knocking us raft water . Next found bouillon cubes aluminum cups made us soup . Then found tea . Sure , made ! Can ’ see serving us tea sat soaking wet water ass ? Now I falling raft I laughing much . We laughing . And dead serious , except goofy giggle crazy grin . What jerk ! Whatever found used . He found shark repellent sprinkled right water . He found marker dye threw water . The next thing finds fishing line dried bait , face lights though Air-Sea Rescue launch sped save us died exposure Germans sent boat Spezia take us prisoner machine-gun us . In time , Orr fishing line water , trolling away happy lark . ‘ Lieutenant , expect catch ? ’ I asked . ‘ Cod , ’ told . And meant .

And ’ spent time launch picked us thirty minutes later , sitting baited fishing line behind , compass lap map spread knees , paddling away hard could dinky blue oar though speeding Majorca . Jesus ! ” Sergeant Knight knew Majorca , Orr , Yossarian told often sanctuaries Spain , Switzerland Sweden American fliers could interned duration war conditions utmost ease luxury merely flying . Yossarian squadron ’ leading authority internment already begun plotting emergency heading Switzerland every mission flew northernmost Italy . He would certainly preferred Sweden , level intelligence high could swim nude beautiful girls low , demurring voices sire whole happy , undisciplined tribes illegitimate Yossarians state would assist parturition launch life without stigma ; Sweden reach , far away , Yossarian waited piece flak would knock one engine Italian Alps provide excuse heading Switzerland . He would even tell pilot guiding . Yossarian often thought scheming pilot trusted fake crippled engine destroy evidence deception belly landing , pilot really trusted McWatt , happiest still got big boot buzzing plane Yossarian ’ tent roaring low bathers beach fierce wind propellers slashed dark furrows water whipped sheets spray flapping back seconds afterward . Dobbs Hungry Joe question , Orr , tinkering valve stove Yossarian limped despondently back tent Dobbs turned . The stove Orr manufacturing inverted metal drum stood middle smooth cement floor constructed . He working sedulously knees . Yossarian tried paying attention limped wearily cot sat labored , drawn-out grunt . Prickles perspiration turning chilly forehead . Dobbs depressed . Doc Daneeka depressed . An ominous vision doom depressed looked Orr . He began ticking variety internal tremors . Nerves twitched , vein one wrist began palpitating . Orr studied Yossarian shoulder , moist lips drawn back around convex rows large buck teeth . Reaching sideways , dug bottle warm beer foot locker , handed Yossarian prying cap . Neither said word . Yossarian sipped bubbles top tilted head back . Orr watched cunningly noiseless grin . Yossarian eyed Orr guardedly . Orr snickered slight , mucid sibilance turned back work , squatting . Yossarian grew tense . “ Don ’ start , ” begged threatening voice , hands tightening around beer bottle . “ Don ’ start working stove. ” Orr cackled quietly . “ I ’ almost finished. ” “ No , ’ . You ’ begin. ” “ Here ’ valve . See ? It ’ almost together. ” “ And ’ take apart . I know ’ , bastard . I ’ seen three hundred times. ” Orr shivered glee . “ I want get leak gasoline line , ” explained . “ I ’ got ’ ooze. ” “ I ’ watch , ” Yossarian confessed tonelessly . “ If want work something big , ’ okay . But valve filled tiny parts , I ’ got patience right watch working hard things goddam small unimportant. ” “ Just ’ small ’ mean ’ unimportant. ” “ I ’ care. ” “ Once ? ” “ When I ’ around . You ’ happy imbecile ’ know means feel way I . Things happen work small things I ’ even begin explain . I find I ’ stand . I start hate , I ’ soon thinking seriously busting bottle head stabbing neck hunting knife . Do understand ? ” Orr nodded intelligently . “ I ’ take valve apart , ” said , began taking apart , working slow , tireless , interminable precision , rustic , ungainly face bent close floor , picking painstakingly minute mechanism fingers limitless , plodding concentration seemed scarcely thinking . Yossarian cursed silently made mind ignore . “ What hell ’ hurry stove , anyway ? ” barked moment later spite . “ It ’ still hot . We ’ probably going swimming later . What worried cold for. ” “ The days getting shorter , ” Orr observed philosophically . “ I ’ like get finished ’ still time . You ’ best stove squadron I ’ . It burn night feed control I ’ fixing , metal plates radiate heat tent . If leave helmet full water thing go sleep , ’ warm water wash ready wake . Won ’ nice ? If want cook eggs soup , ’ set pot turn fire up. ” “ What mean , ? ” Yossarian wanted know . “ Where going ? ” Orr ’ stunted torso shook suddenly muffled spasm amusement . “ I ’ know , ” exclaimed , weird , wavering giggle gushed suddenly chattering buck teeth like exploding jet emotion . He still laughing continued , voice clogged saliva . “ If keep shooting way , I ’ know I ’ going be. ” Yossarian moved . “ Why ’ try stop flying , Orr ? You ’ got excuse. ” “ I ’ got eighteen missions. ” “ But ’ shot almost every one . You ’ either ditching crash-landing every time go up. ” “ Oh , I ’ mind flying missions . I guess ’ lots fun . You ought try flying ’ flying lead . Just laughs . Tee-hee. ” Orr gazed Yossarian corners eyes look pointed mirth . Yossarian avoided stare . “ They ’ got flying lead again. ” “ When ’ flying lead . If brains , know ’ ? You ’ go right Piltchard Wren tell want fly me. ” “ And get shot every time go ? What ’ fun ? ” “ That ’ ought , ” Orr insisted . “ I guess I ’ best pilot around comes ditching making crash landings . It would good practice you. ” “ Good practice ? ” “ Good practice case ever ditch make crash landing . Tee-hee-hee. ” “ Have got another bottle beer ? ” Yossarian asked morosely . “ Do want bust head ? ” This time Yossarian laugh . “ Like whore apartment Rome ? ” Orr sniggered lewdly , bulging crab apple cheeks blowing outward pleasure . “ Do really want know hitting head shoe ? ” teased . “ I know , ” Yossarian teased back . “ Nately ’ whore told me. ” Orr grinned like gargoyle . “ No ’ t. ” Yossarian felt sorry Orr . Orr small ugly . Who would protect lived ? Who would protect warm-hearted , simple-minded gnome like Orr rowdies cliques expert athletes like Appleby flies eyes would walk right swaggering conceit self-assurance every chance got ? Yossarian worried frequently Orr . Who would shield animosity deceit , people ambition embittered snobbery big shot ’ wife , squalid , corrupting indignities profit motive friendly neighborhood butcher inferior meat ? Orr happy unsuspecting simpleton thick mass wavy polychromatic hair parted center . He would mere child ’ play . They would take money , screw wife show kindness children . Yossarian felt flood compassion sweep . Orr eccentric midget , freakish , likable dwarf smutty mind thousand valuable skills would keep low income group life . He could use soldering iron hammer two boards together wood split nails bend . He could drill holes . He built good deal tent Yossarian away hospital . He filed chiseled perfect channel cement slender gasoline line flush floor ran stove tank built outside elevated platform . He constructed andirons fireplace excess bomb parts filled stout silver logs , framed stained wood photographs girls big breasts torn cheesecake magazines hung mantelpiece . Orr could open paint . He could mix paint , thin paint , remove paint . He could chop wood measure things ruler . He knew build fires . He could dig holes , real gift bringing water cans canteens tanks near mess hall . He could engross inconsequential task hours without growing restless bored , oblivious fatigue stump tree , almost taciturn . He uncanny knowledge wildlife afraid dogs cats beetles moths , foods like scrod tripe . Yossarian sighed drearily began brooding rumored mission Bologna . The valve Orr dismantling size thumb contained thirty-seven separate parts , excluding casing , many minute Orr required pinch tightly tips fingernails placed carefully floor orderly , catalogued rows , never quickening movements slowing , never tiring , never pausing relentless , methodical , monotonous procedure unless leer Yossarian maniacal mischief . Yossarian tried watch . He counted parts thought would go clear mind . He turned away , shutting eyes , even worse , sounds , tiny maddening , indefatigable , distinct clicks rustles hands weightless parts . Orr breathing rhythmically noise stertorous repulsive . Yossarian clenched fists looked long bone-handled hunting knife hanging holster cot dead man tent . As soon thought stabbing Orr , tension eased . The idea murdering Orr ridiculous began consider seriously queer whimsy fascination . He searched nape Orr ’ neck probable site medulla oblongata . Just daintiest stick would kill solve many serious , agonizing problems . “ Does hurt ? ” Orr asked precisely moment , though protective instinct . Yossarian eyed closely . “ Does hurt ? ” “ Your leg , ” said Orr strange , mysterious laugh . “ You still limp little. ” “ It ’ habit , I guess , ” said Yossarian , breathing relief . “ I ’ probably get soon. ” Orr rolled sideways floor came one knee , facing toward Yossarian . “ Do remember , ” drawled reflectively , air labored recollection , “ girl hitting head day Rome ? ” He chuckled Yossarian ’ involuntary exclamation tricked annoyance . “ I ’ make deal girl . I ’ tell girl hitting head shoe day answer one question. ” “ What ’ question ? ” “ Did ever screw Nately ’ girl ? ” Yossarian laughed surprise . “ Me ? No . Now tell girl hit shoe. ” “ That ’ question , ” Orr informed victorious delight . “ That conversation . She acts like screwed her. ” “ Well , I ’ . How act ? ” “ She acts like ’ like you. ” “ She ’ like anyone. ” “ She likes Captain Black , ” Orr reminded . “ That ’ treats like dirt . Anyone get girl way. ” “ She wears slave bracelet leg name it. ” “ He makes wear needle Nately. ” “ She even gives money gets Nately. ” “ Listen , want ? ” “ Did ever screw girl ? ” “ Your girl ? Who hell girl ? ” “ The one hit head shoe. ” “ I ’ couple times , ” Yossarian admitted . “ Since girl ? What getting ? ” “ She ’ like , either. ” “ What hell I care likes ? She likes much likes you. ” “ Did ever hit head shoe ? ” “ Orr , I ’ tired . Why ’ leave alone ? ” “ Tee-hee-hee . How skinny countess Rome skinny daughter-in-law ? ” Orr persisted impishly increasing zest . “ Did ever screw ? ” “ Oh , I wish I could , ” sighed Yossarian honestly , imagining , mere question , prurient , used , decaying feel petting hands teeny , pulpy buttocks breasts . “ They ’ like either , ” commented Orr . “ They like Aarfy , like Nately , ’ like . Women ’ seem like . I think think ’ bad influence. ” “ Women crazy , ” Yossarian answered , waited grimly knew coming next . “ How girl ? ” Orr asked pretense pensive curiosity . “ The fat one ? The bald one ? You know , fat bald one Sicily turban kept sweating us night long ? Is crazy ? ” “ Didn ’ like either ? ” “ How could girl hair ? ” “ How I supposed know hair ? ” “ I knew , ” Orr bragged . “ I knew time. ” “ You knew bald ? ” Yossarian exclaimed wonder . “ No , I knew valve ’ work I left part , ” Orr answered , glowing cranberry-red elation duped Yossarian . “ Will please hand small composition gasket rolled ? It ’ right near foot. ” “ No ’ t. ” “ Right , ” said Orr , took hold something invisible tips fingernails held Yossarian see . “ Now I ’ start again. ” “ I ’ kill . I ’ murder right spot. ” “ Why ’ ever fly ? ” Orr asked suddenly , looked straight Yossarian ’ face first time . “ There , ’ question I want answer . Why ’ ever fly ? ” Yossarian turned away intense shame embarrassment . “ I told . They ’ got flying lead bombardier time. ” “ That ’ , ” Orr said , shaking head . “ You went Piltchard Wren first Avignon mission told ’ ever want fly . That ’ , ’ ? ” Yossarian felt skin turn hot . “ No I ’ , ” lied . “ Yes , ” Orr insisted equably . “ You asked assign plane piloted , Dobbs Huple ’ confidence us controls . And Piltchard Wren said ’ make exception ’ fair men fly us. ” “ So ? ” said Yossarian . “ It ’ make difference , ? ” “ But ’ never made fly me. ” Orr , working knees , addressing Yossarian without bitterness reproach , injured humility , infinitely painful observe , although still grinning snickering , though situation comic . “ You really ought fly , know . I ’ pretty good pilot , I ’ take care . I may get knocked lot , ’ fault , nobody ’ ever hurt plane . Yes , sir-if brains , know ’ ? You ’ go right Piltchard Wren tell want fly missions me. ” Yossarian leaned forward peered closely Orr ’ inscrutable mask contradictory emotions . “ Are trying tell something ? ” “ Tee-hee-hee-hee , ” Orr responded . “ I ’ trying tell big girl shoe hitting head day . But ’ let me. ” “ Tell me. ” “ Will fly ? ” Yossarian laughed shook head . “ You ’ get knocked water again. ” Orr get knocked water rumored mission Bologna flown , landed single-engine plane smashing jar choppy , windswept waves tossing falling warlike black thunderclouds mobilizing overhead . He late getting plane ended alone raft began drifting away men raft sight time Air-Sea Rescue launch came plowing wind splattering raindrops take aboard . Night already falling time returned squadron . There word Orr . “ Don ’ worry , ” reassured Kid Sampson , still wrapped heavy blankets raincoat swaddled boat rescuers . “ He ’ probably picked already ’ drown storm . It ’ last long . I bet ’ show minute. ” Yossarian walked back tent wait Orr show minute lit fire make things warm . The stove worked perfectly , strong , robust blaze could raised lowered turning tap Orr finally finished repairing . A light rain falling , drumming softly tent , trees , ground . Yossarian cooked hot soup ready Orr ate time passed . He hard-boiled eggs Orr ate . Then ate whole tin Cheddar cheese package K rations . Each time caught worrying made remember Orr could everything broke silent laughter picture Orr raft Sergeant Knight described , bent forward busy , preoccupied smile map compass lap , stuffing one soaking-wet chocolate bar another grinning , tittering mouth paddled away dutifully lightning , thunder rain bright-blue useless toy oar , fishing line dried bait trailing behind . Yossarian really doubt Orr ’ ability survive . If fish could caught silly fishing line , Orr would catch , codfish , Orr would catch codfish , even though codfish ever caught waters . Yossarian put another soup cook ate hot . Every time car door slammed , broke hopeful smile turned expectantly toward entrance , listening footsteps . He knew moment Orr would come walking tent big , glistening , rain-soaked eyes , cheeks buck teeth , looking ludicrously like jolly New England oysterman yellow oilskin rain hat slicker numerous sizes large holding proudly Yossarian ’ amusement great dead codfish caught . But ’ . 29 PECKEM There word Orr next day , Sergeant Whitcomb , commendable dispatch considerable hope , dropped reminder tickler file send form letter Colonel Cathcart ’ signature Orr ’ next kin nine days elapsed . There word General Peckem ’ headquarters , though , Yossarian drawn crowd officers enlisted men shorts bathing trunks buzzing grumpy confusion around bulletin board outside orderly room . “ What ’ different Sunday , I want know ? ” Hungry Joe demanding vociferously Chief White Halfoat . “ Why ’ parade Sunday ’ parade every Sunday ? Huh ? ” Yossarian worked way front let long , agonized groan read terse announcement : Due circumstances beyond control , big parade Sunday afternoon . Colonel Scheisskopf Dobbs right . They indeed sending everyone overseas , even Lieutenant Scheisskopf , resisted move vigor wisdom command reported duty General Peckem ’ office mood grave discontent . General Peckem welcomed Colonel Scheisskopf effusive charm said delighted . An additional colonel staff meant could begin agitating two additional majors , four additional captains , sixteen additional lieutenants untold quantities additional enlisted men , typewriters , desks , filing cabinets , automobiles substantial equipment supplies would contribute prestige position increase striking power war declared General Dreedle . He two full colonels ; General Dreedle five , four combat commanders . With almost intriguing , General Peckem executed maneuver would eventually double strength . And General Dreedle getting drunk often . The future looked wonderful , General Peckem contemplated bright new colonel enchantedly effulgent smile . In matters consequence , General P. P. Peckem , always remarked criticize work close associate publicly , realist . He handsome , pink-skinned man fifty-three . His manner always casual relaxed , uniforms custom-made . He silver-gray hair , slightly myopic eyes thin , overhanging , sensual lips . He perceptive , graceful , sophisticated man sensitive everyone ’ weaknesses found everyone absurd . General Peckem laid great , fastidious stress small matters taste style . He always augmenting things . Approaching events never coming , always upcoming . It true wrote memorandums praising recommending authority enhanced include combat operations ; wrote memoranda . And prose memoranda officers always turgid , stilted , ambiguous . The errors others inevitably deplorable . Regulations stringent , data never obtained reliable source , always obtained . General Peckem frequently constrained . Things often incumbent upon , frequently acted greatest reluctance . It never escaped memory neither black white color , never used verbal meant oral . He could quote glibly Plato , Nietzsche , Montaigne , Theodore Roosevelt , Marquis de Sade Warren G. Harding . A virgin audience like Colonel Scheisskopf grist General Peckem ’ mill , stimulating opportunity throw open whole dazzling erudite treasure house puns , wisecracks , slanders , homilies , anecdotes , proverbs , epigrams , apophthegms , bon mots pungent sayings . He beamed urbanely began orienting Colonel Scheisskopf new surroundings . “ My fault , ” observed practiced good humor , watching effect words , “ I faults. ” Colonel Scheisskopf ’ laugh , General Peckem stunned . A heavy doubt crushed enthusiasm . He opened one trusted paradoxes , positively alarmed slightest flicker acknowledgment moved across impervious face , began remind suddenly , hue texture , unused soap eraser . Perhaps Colonel Scheisskopf tired , General Peckem granted charitably ; come long way , everything unfamiliar . General Peckem ’ attitude toward personnel command , officers enlisted men , marked easy spirit tolerance permissiveness . He mentioned often people worked met halfway , would meet halfway , result , always added astute chuckle , never meeting minds . General Peckem thought aesthetic intellectual . When people disagreed , urged objective . And indeed objective Peckem gazed Colonel Scheisskopf encouragingly resumed indoctrination attitude magnanimous forgiveness . “ You ’ come us time , Scheisskopf . The summer offensive petered , thanks incompetent leadership supply troops , I crying need tough , experienced , competent officer like help produce memoranda upon rely heavily let people know good much work ’ turning . I hope prolific writer. ” “ I ’ know anything writing , ” Colonel Scheisskopf retorted sullenly . “ Well , ’ let trouble , ” General Peckem continued careless flick wrist . “ Just pass work I assign along somebody else trust luck . We call delegation responsibility . Somewhere near lowest level co-ordinated organization I run people get work done reaches , everything manages run along smoothly without much effort part . I suppose ’ I good executive . Nothing large department really important , ’ never rush . On hand , important let people know great deal . Let know find shorthanded . I ’ already put requisition two majors , four captains sixteen lieutenants give hand . While none work important , important great deal . Don ’ agree ? ” “ What parades ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf broke . “ What parades ? ” inquired General Peckem feeling polish ’ getting across . “ Won ’ I able conduct parades every Sunday afternoon ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf demanded petulantly . “ No . Of course . What ever gave idea ? ” “ But said I could. ” “ Who said could ? ” “ The officers sent overseas . They told I ’ able march men around parades I wanted to. ” “ They lied you. ” “ That ’ fair , sir. ” “ I ’ sorry , Scheisskopf . I ’ willing everything I make happy , parades question . We ’ enough men organization make much parade , combat units would rise open rebellion tried make march . I ’ afraid ’ hold back awhile get control . Then want men. ” “ What wife ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf demanded disgruntled suspicion . “ I ’ still able send , ’ I ? ” “ Your wife ? Why world want ? ” “ A husband wife together. ” “ That ’ question also. ” “ But said I could send ! ” “ They lied again. ” “ They right lie ! ” Colonel Scheisskopf protested , eyes wetting indignation . “ Of course right , ” General Peckem snapped cold calculated severity , resolving right test mettle new colonel fire . “ Don ’ ass , Scheisskopf . People right anything ’ forbidden law , ’ law lying . Now , ’ ever waste time sentimental platitudes . Do hear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” murmured Colonel Scheisskopf Colonel Scheisskopf wilted pathetically , General Peckem blessed fates sent weakling subordinate . A man spunk would unthinkable . Having , General Peckem relented . He enjoy humiliating men . “ If wife Wac , I could probably transferred . But ’ I do. ” “ She friend ’ Wac , ” Colonel Scheisskopf offered hopefully . “ I ’ afraid ’ good enough . Have Mrs. Scheisskopf join Wacs wants , I ’ bring . But meantime , dear Colonel , let ’ get back little war , may . Here , briefly , military situation confronts us. ” General Peckem rose moved toward rotary rack enormous colored maps . Colonel Scheisskopf blanched . “ We ’ going combat , ? ” blurted horror . “ Oh , , course , ” General Peckem assured indulgently , companionable laugh . “ Please give credit , ’ ? That ’ ’ still Rome . Certainly , I ’ like Florence , , I could keep closer touch ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . But Florence still bit near actual fighting suit me. ” General Peckem lifted wooden pointer swept rubber tip cheerfully across Italy one coast . “ These , Scheisskopf , Germans . They ’ dug mountains solidly Gothic Line ’ pushed till late next spring , although ’ going stop clods charge trying . That gives us Special Services almost nine months achieve objective . And objective capture every bomber group U.S. Air Force . After , ” said General Peckem low , well-modulated chuckle , “ dropping bombs enemy ’ special service , I wonder world . Don ’ agree ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf gave indication agree , General Peckem already entranced loquacity notice . “ Our position right excellent . Reinforcements like keep arriving , enough time plan entire strategy carefully . Our immediate goal , ” said , “ right here. ” And General Peckem swung pointer south island Pianosa tapped significantly upon large word lettered black grease pencil . The word DREEDLE . Colonel Scheisskopf , squinting , moved close map , first time since entered room light comprehension shed dim glow stolid face . “ I think I understand , ” exclaimed . “ Yes , I know I understand . Our first job capture Dreedle away enemy . Right ? ” General Peckem laughed benignly . “ No , Scheisskopf . Dreedle ’ side , Dreedle enemy . General Dreedle commands four bomb groups simply must capture order continue offensive . Conquering General Dreedle give us aircraft vital bases need carry operations areas . And battle , way , won. ” General Peckem drifted toward window , laughing quietly , settled back sill arms folded , greatly satisfied wit knowledgeable , blase impudence . The skilled choice words exercising exquisitely titillating . General Peckem liked listening talk , like listening talk . “ General Dreedle simply ’ know cope , ” gloated . “ I keep invading jurisdiction comments criticisms really none business , ’ know . When accuses seeking undermine , I merely answer purpose calling attention errors strengthen war effort eliminating inefficiency . Then I ask innocently ’ opposed improving war effort . Oh , grumbles bristles bellows , ’ really quite helpless . He ’ simply style . He ’ turning quite souse , know . The poor blockhead ’ even general . He tone , tone . Thank God ’ going last. ” General Peckem chuckled jaunty relish sailed smoothly along toward favorite learned allusion . “ I sometimes think Fortinbras-ha , ha-in play Hamlet William Shakespeare , keeps circling circling around action everything else falls apart , strolls end pick pieces . Shakespeare is- “ “ I ’ know anything plays , ” Colonel Scheisskopf broke bluntly . General Peckem looked amazement . Never reference Shakespeare ’ hallowed Hamlet ignored trampled upon rude indifference . He began wonder genuine concern sort shithead Pentagon foisted . “ What know ? ” asked acidly . “ Parades , ” answered Colonel Scheisskopf eagerly . “ Will I able send memos parades ? ” “ As long ’ schedule any. ” General Peckem returned chair still wearing frown . “ And long ’ interfere main assignment recommending authority Special Services expanded include combat activities. ” “ Can I schedule parades call ? ” General Peckem brightened instantly . “ Why , ’ wonderful idea ! But send weekly announcements postponing parades . Don ’ even bother schedule . That would infinitely disconcerting. ” General Peckem blossoming spryly cordiality . “ Yes , Scheisskopf , ” said , “ I think ’ really hit something . After , combat commander could possibly quarrel us notifying men ’ parade coming Sunday ? We ’ merely stating widely known fact . But implication beautiful . Yes , positively beautiful . We ’ implying could schedule parade chose . I ’ going like , Scheisskopf . Stop introduce Colonel Cargill tell ’ . I know two like other. ” Colonel Cargill came storming General Peckem ’ office minute later furor timid resentment . “ I ’ longer Scheisskopf , ” complained . “ Why ’ I one call parades ? ” “ Because Scheisskopf experience parades , ’ . You call U.S.O . shows want . In fact ’ ? Just think places ’ getting U.S.O . show given day . Think places big-name entertainer ’ visiting . Yes , Cargill , I think ’ hit something . I think ’ thrown open whole new area operation us . Tell Colonel Scheisskopf I want work along supervision . And send see ’ giving instructions. ” “ Colonel Cargill says told want work along supervision U.S.O . project , ” Colonel Scheisskopf complained . “ I told thing , ” answered General Peckem . “ Confidentially , Scheisskopf , I ’ happy Colonel Cargill . He ’ bossy ’ slow . I ’ like keep close eye ’ see ’ get little work him. ” “ He keeps butting , ” Colonel Cargill protested . “ He ’ let get work done. ” “ There ’ something funny Scheisskopf , ” General Peckem agreed reflectively . “ Keep close eye see ’ find ’ to. ” “ Now ’ butting business ! ” Colonel Scheisskopf cried . “ Don ’ let worry , Scheisskopf , ” said General Peckem , congratulating adeptly fit Colonel Scheisskopf standard method operation . Already two colonels barely speaking terms . “ Colonel Cargill envies splendid job ’ parades . He ’ afraid I ’ going put charge bomb patterns. ” Colonel Scheisskopf ears . “ What bomb patterns ? ” “ Bomb patterns ? ” General Peckem repeated , twinkling self-satisfied good humor . “ A bomb pattern term I dreamed several weeks ago . It means nothing , ’ surprised rapidly ’ caught . Why , I ’ got sorts people convinced I think ’ important bombs explode close together make neat aerial photograph . There ’ one colonel Pianosa ’ hardly concerned whether hits target . Let ’ fly fun today . It make Colonel Cargill jealous , I learned Wintergreen morning General Dreedle Sardinia . It drives General Dreedle insane find I ’ inspecting one installations ’ inspecting another . We may even get time briefing . They ’ bombing tiny undefended village , reducing whole community rubble . I Wintergreen-Wintergreen ’ ex-sergeant , way-that mission entirely unnecessary . Its purpose delay German reinforcements time ’ even planning offensive . But ’ way things go elevate mediocre people positions authority. ” He gestured languidly toward gigantic map Italy . “ Why , tiny mountain village insignificant ’ even there. ” They arrived Colonel Cathcart ’ group late attend preliminary briefing hear Major Danby insist , “ But , I tell . It ’ , ’ there. ” “ It ’ ? ” Dunbar demanded defiantly , pretending see . “ It ’ right map road makes slight turn . Can ’ see slight turn map ? ” “ No , I ’ see it. ” “ I see , ” volunteered Havermeyer , marked spot Dunbar ’ map . “ And ’ good picture village right photographs . I understand whole thing . The purpose mission knock whole village sliding side mountain create roadblock Germans clear . Is right ? ” “ That ’ right , ” said Major Danby , mopping perspiring forehead handkerchief . “ I ’ glad somebody beginning understand . These two armored divisions coming Austria Italy along road . The village built steep incline rubble houses buildings destroy certainly tumble right pile upon road. ” “ What hell difference make ? ” Dunbar wanted know , Yossarian watched excitedly mixture awe adulation . “ It take couple days clear it. ” Major Danby trying avoid argument . “ Well , apparently makes difference Headquarters , ” answered conciliatory tone . “ I suppose ’ ordered mission. ” “ Have people village warned ? ” asked McWatt . Major Danby dismayed McWatt registering opposition . “ No , I ’ think so. ” “ Haven ’ dropped leaflets telling time ’ flying hit ? ” asked Yossarian . “ Can ’ even tip ’ get way ? ” “ No , I ’ think so. ” Major Danby swearing still shifting eyes uneasily . “ The Germans might find choose another road . I ’ sure . I ’ making assumptions. ” “ They ’ even take shelter , ” Dunbar argued bitterly . “ They ’ pour streets wave see planes coming , children dogs old people . Jesus Christ ! Why ’ leave alone ? ” “ Why ’ create roadblock somewhere else ? ” asked McWatt . “ Why must ? ” “ I ’ know , ” Major Danby answered unhappily . “ I ’ know . Look , fellows , ’ got confidence people us issue orders . They know ’ doing. ” “ The hell , ” said Dunbar . “ What ’ trouble ? ” inquired Colonel Korn , moving leisurely across briefing room hands pockets tan shirt baggy . “ Oh , trouble , Colonel , ” said Major Danby , trying nervously cover . “ We ’ discussing mission. ” “ They ’ want bomb village , ” Havermeyer snickered , giving Major Danby away . “ You prick ! ” Yossarian said Havermeyer . “ You leave Havermeyer alone , ” Colonel Korn ordered Yossarian curtly . He recognized Yossarian drunk accosted roughly officers ’ club one night first mission Bologna , swung displeasure prudently Dunbar . “ Why ’ want bomb village ? ” “ It ’ cruel , ’ why. ” “ Cruel ? ” asked Colonel Korn cold good humor , frightened momentarily uninhibited vehemence Dunbar ’ hostility . “ Would less cruel let two German divisions fight troops ? American lives stake , , know . Would rather see American blood spilled ? ” “ American blood spilled . But people living peace . Why ’ leave hell alone ? ” “ Yes , ’ easy talk , ” Colonel Korn jeered . “ You ’ safe Pianosa . It ’ make difference German reinforcements arrive , ? ” Dunbar turned crimson embarrassment replied voice suddenly defensive . “ Why ’ create roadblock somewhere else ? Couldn ’ bomb slope mountain road ? ” “ Would rather go back Bologna ? ” The question , asked quietly , rang like shot created silence room awkward menacing . Yossarian prayed intensely , shame , Dunbar would keep mouth shut . Dunbar dropped gaze , Colonel Korn knew . “ No , I thought , ” continued undisguised scorn . “ You know , Colonel Cathcart I go lot trouble get milk run like . If ’ sooner fly missions Bologna , Spezia Ferrara , get targets trouble all. ” His eyes gleamed dangerously behind rimless glasses , muddy jowls square hard . “ Just let know. ” “ I would , ” responded Havermeyer eagerly another boastful snicker . “ I like fly Bologna straight level head bombsight listen flak pumping away around . I get big kick way men come charging mission call dirty names . Even enlisted men get sore enough curse want take socks me. ” Colonel Korn chucked Havermeyer chin jovially , ignoring , addressed Dunbar Yossarian dry monotone . “ You ’ got sacred word . Nobody distressed lousy wops hills Colonel Cathcart . Mais c ” est la guerre . Try remember ’ start war Italy . That ’ aggressors Italy . And ’ possibly inflict much cruelty Italians , Germans , Russians Chinese ’ already inflicting themselves. ” Colonel Korn gave Major Danby ’ shoulder friendly squeeze without changing unfriendly expression . “ Carry briefing , Danby . And make sure understand importance tight bomb pattern. ” “ Oh , , Colonel , ” Major Danby blurted , blinking upward . “ Not target . I ’ told space bombs sixty feet apart ’ roadblock full length village instead one spot . It much effective roadblock loose bomb pattern. ” “ We ’ care roadblock , ” Colonel Korn informed . “ Colonel Cathcart wants come mission good clean aerial photograph ’ ashamed send channels . Don ’ forget General Peckem full briefing , know feels bomb patterns . Incidentally , Major , ’ better hurry details clear gets . General Peckem ’ stand you. ” “ Oh , , Colonel , ” Major Danby corrected obligingly . “ It ’ General Dreedle ’ stand me. ” “ General Peckem ’ stand either . In fact , one stand . Finish ’ , Danby , disappear . I ’ conduct briefing. ” “ Where ’ Major Danby ? ” Colonel Cathcart inquired , driven full briefing General Peckem Colonel Scheisskopf . “ He asked permission leave soon saw driving , ” answered Colonel Korn . “ He ’ afraid General Peckem ’ like . I going conduct briefing anyway . I much better job. ” “ Splendid ! ” said Colonel Cathcart . “ No ! ” Colonel Cathcart countermanded instant later remembered good job Colonel Korn done General Dreedle first Avignon briefing . “ I ’ myself. ” Colonel Cathcart braced knowledge one General Peckem ’ favorites took charge meeting , snapping words crisply attentive audience subordinate officers bluff dispassionate toughness picked General Dreedle . He knew cut fine figure platform open shirt collar , cigarette holder , close-cropped , gray-tipped curly black hair . He breezed along beautifully , even emulating certain characteristic mispronunciations General Dreedle ’ , least bit intimidated General Peckem ’ new colonel suddenly recalled General Peckem detested General Dreedle . Then voice cracked , confidence left . He stumbled ahead instinct burning humiliation . He suddenly terror Colonel Scheisskopf . Another colonel area meant another rival , another enemy , another person hated . And one tough ! A horrifying thought occurred Colonel Cathcart : Suppose Colonel Scheisskopf already bribed men room begin moaning , done first Avignon mission . How could silence ? What terrible black eye would ! Colonel Cathcart seized fright almost beckoned Colonel Korn . Somehow held together synchronized watches . When done , knew , could end time . He come crisis . He wanted laugh Colonel Scheisskopf ’ face triumph spite . He proved brilliantly pressure , concluded briefing inspiring peroration every instinct told masterful exhibition eloquent tact subtlety . “ Now , men , ” exhorted . “ We us today distinguished guest , General Peckem Special Services , man gives us softball bats , comic books U.S.O . shows . I want dedicate mission . Go bomb-for , country , God , great American , General P. P. Peckem . And let ’ see put bombs dime ! ” 30 DUNBAR Yossarian longer gave damn bombs fell , although go far Dunbar , dropped bombs hundreds yards past village would face court-martial could ever shown done deliberately . Without word even Yossarian , Dunbar washed hands mission . The fall hospital either shown light scrambled brains ; impossible say . Dunbar seldom laughed seemed wasting away . He snarled belligerently superior officers , even Major Danby , crude surly profane even front chaplain , afraid Dunbar seemed wasting away also . The chaplain ’ pilgrimage Wintergreen proved abortive ; another shrine empty . Wintergreen busy see chaplain . A brash assistant brought chaplain stolen Zippo cigarette lighter gift informed condescendingly Wintergreen deeply involved wartime activities concern matters trivial number missions men fly . The chaplain worried Dunbar brooded Yossarian Orr gone . To chaplain , lived spacious tent whose pointy top sealed gloomy solitude night like cap tomb , seemed incredible Yossarian really preferred living alone wanted roommates . As lead bombardier , Yossarian McWatt pilot , one consolation , although still utterly undefended . There way fight back . He could even see McWatt co-pilot post nose . All could ever see Aarfy , whose fustian , moon-faced ineptitude finally lost patience , minutes agonizing fury frustration sky hungered demoted wing plane loaded machine gun compartment instead precision bombsight really need , powerful , heavy fifty-caliber machine gun could seize vengefully hands turn loose savagely demons tyrannizing : smoky black puffs flak ; German antiaircraft gunners could even see could possibly harm machine gun even ever take time open fire , Havermeyer Appleby lead plane fearless straight level bomb run second mission Bologna flak two hundred twenty-four cannons knocked one Orr ’ engines last time sent ditching sea Genoa La Spezia brief thunderstorm broke . Actually , much could powerful machine gun except load test-fire rounds . It use bombsight . He could really cut loose attacking German fighters , German fighters , could even swing way around helpless faces pilots like Huple Dobbs order back carefully ground , ordered Kid Sampson back , exactly want Dobbs Huple hideous first mission Avignon moment realized fantastic pickle , moment found aloft wing plane Dobbs Huple flight headed Havermeyer Appleby . Dobbs Huple ? Huple Dobbs ? Who ? What preposterous madness float thin air two miles high inch two metal , sustained death meager skill intelligence two vapid strangers , beardless kid named Huple nervous nut like Dobbs , really go nuts right plane , running amuck target without leaving copilot ’ seat grabbing controls Huple plunge chilling dive tore Yossarian ’ headset loose brought right back inside dense flak almost escaped . The next thing knew , another stranger , radio-gunner named Snowden , dying back . It impossible positive Dobbs killed , Yossarian plugged headset back , Dobbs already intercom pleading someone go front help bombardier . And almost immediately Snowden broke , whimpering , “ Help . Please help . I ’ cold . I ’ cold. ” And Yossarian crawled slowly nose top bomb bay wriggled back rear section plane-passing first-aid kit way return for-to treat Snowden wrong wound , yawning , raw , melon-shaped hole big football outside thigh , unsevered , blood-soaked muscle fibers inside pulsating weirdly like blind things lives , oval , naked wound almost foot long made Yossarian moan shock sympathy instant spied nearly made vomit . And small , slight tail-gunner lying floor beside Snowden dead faint , face white handkerchief , Yossarian sprang forward revulsion help first . Yes , long run , much safer flying McWatt , even safe McWatt , loved flying much went buzzing boldly inches ground Yossarian nose way back training flight break new bombardier whole replacement crew Colonel Cathcart obtained Orr lost . The practice bomb range side Pianosa , , flying back , McWatt edged belly lazing , slow-cruising plane crest mountains middle , instead maintaining altitude , jolted engines open way , lurched one side , Yossarian ’ astonishment , began following falling land fast plane would go , wagging wings gaily skimming massive , grinding , hammering roar rocky rise dip rolling terrain like dizzy gull wild brown waves . Yossarian petrified . The new bombardier beside sat demurely bewitched grin kept whistling “ Whee ! ” Yossarian wanted reach crush idiotic face one hand flinched flung away boulders hillocks lashing branches trees loomed front rushed past underneath sinking , streaking blur . No one right take frightful risks life . “ Go , go , go ! ” shouted frantically McWatt , hating venomously , McWatt singing buoyantly intercom probably ’ hear . Yossarian , blazing rage almost sobbing revenge , hurled crawlway fought way dragging weight gravity inertia arrived main section pulled flight deck , stand trembling behind McWatt pilot ’ seat . He looked desperately gun , gray-black.45 automatic could cock ram right base McWatt ’ skull . There gun . There hunting knife either , weapon could bludgeon stab , Yossarian grasped jerked collar McWatt ’ coveralls tightening fists shouted go , go . The land still swimming underneath flashing overhead sides . McWatt looked back Yossarian laughed joyfully though Yossarian sharing fun . Yossarian slid hands around McWatt ’ bare throat squeezed . McWatt turned stiff : “ Go , ” Yossarian ordered unmistakably teeth low , menacing voice . “ Or I ’ kill you. ” Rigid caution , McWatt cut motors back climbed gradually . Yossarian ’ hands weakened McWatt ’ neck slid shoulders dangle inertly . He angry . He ashamed . When McWatt turned , sorry hands wished someplace could bury . They felt dead . McWatt gazed deeply . There friendliness stare . “ Boy , ” said coldly , “ sure must pretty bad shape . You ought go home. ” “ They ’ let me. ” Yossarian answered averted eyes , crept away . Yossarian stepped flight deck seated floor , hanging head guilt remorse . He covered sweat . McWatt set course directly back toward field . Yossarian wondered whether McWatt would go operations tent see Piltchard Wren request Yossarian never assigned plane , Yossarian gone surreptitiously speak Dobbs Huple Orr , unsuccessfully , Aarfy . He never seen McWatt look displeased , never seen lighthearted mood , wondered whether lost another friend . But McWatt winked reassuringly climbed plane joshed hospitably credulous new pilot bombardier jeep ride back squadron , although address word Yossarian four returned parachutes separated two walking side side toward row tents . Then McWatt ’ sparsely freckled tan Scotch-Irish face broke suddenly smile dug knuckles playfully Yossarian ’ ribs , though throwing punch . “ You louse , ” laughed . “ Were really going kill ? ” Yossarian grinned penitently shook head . “ No . I ’ think so. ” “ I ’ realize got bad . Boy ! Why ’ talk somebody ? ” “ I talk everybody . What hell ’ matter ? Don ’ ever hear ? ” “ I guess I never really believed you. ” “ Aren ’ ever afraid ? ” “ Maybe I ought be. ” “ Not even missions ? ” “ I guess I ’ brains enough. ” McWatt laughed sheepishly . “ There many ways get killed , ” Yossarian commented , “ find one more. ” McWatt smiled . “ Say , I bet must really scare I buzz tent , huh ? ” “ It scares death . I ’ told that. ” “ I thought noise complaining about. ” McWatt made resigned shrug . “ Oh , well , hell , ” sang . “ I guess I ’ give up. ” But McWatt incorrigible , , never buzzed Yossarian ’ tent , never missed opportunity buzz beach roar like fierce low-flying thunderbolt raft water secluded hollow sand Yossarian lay feeling Nurse Duckett playing hearts , poker pinochle Nately , Dunbar Hungry Joe . Yossarian met Nurse Duckett almost every afternoon free came beach side narrow swell shoulder-high dunes separating area officers enlisted men went swimming nude . Nately , Dunbar Hungry Joe would come , . McWatt would occasionally join , often Aarfy , always arrived pudgily full uniform never removed clothing shoes hat ; Aarfy never went swimming . The men wore swimming trunks deference Nurse Duckett , deference also Nurse Cramer , accompanied Nurse Duckett Yossarian beach every time sat haughtily ten yards away . No one Aarfy ever made reference naked men sun-bathing full view farther beach jumping diving enormous white-washed raft bobbed empty oil drums beyond silt sand . Nurse Cramer sat angry Yossarian disappointed Nurse Duckett . Nurse Sue Ann Duckett despised Aarfy , another one numerous fetching traits Nurse Duckett Yossarian enjoyed . He enjoyed Nurse Sue Ann Duckett ’ long white legs supple , callipygous ass ; often neglected remember quite slim fragile waist hurt unintentionally moments passion hugged roughly . He loved manner sleepy acquiescence lay beach dusk . He drew solace sedation nearness . He craving touch always , remain always physical communication . He liked encircle ankle loosely fingers played cards Nately , Dunbar Hungry Joe , lightly lovingly caress downy skin fair , smooth thigh backs nails , dreamily , sensuously , almost unconsciously , slide proprietary , respectful hand shell-like ridge spine beneath elastic strap top two-piece bathing suit always wore contain cover tiny , long-nippled breasts . He loved Nurse Duckett ’ serene , flattered response , sense attachment displayed proudly . Hungry Joe craving feel Nurse Duckett , , restrained Yossarian ’ forbidding glower . Nurse Duckett flirted Hungry Joe keep heat , round light-brown eyes glimmered mischief every time Yossarian rapped sharply elbow fist make stop . The men played cards towel , undershirt , blanket , Nurse Duckett mixed extra deck cards , sitting back resting sand dune . When shuffling extra deck cards , sat squinting tiny pocket mirror , brushing mascara curling reddish eyelashes birdbrained effort make longer permanently . Occasionally able stack cards spoil deck way discover well game , laughed glowed blissful gratification hurled cards disgustedly began punching sharply arms legs called filthy names warned stop fooling around . She would prattle nonsensically striving hardest think , pink flush elation crept cheeks gave sharp raps arms legs fists told shut . Nurse Duckett reveled attention ducked short chestnut bangs joy Yossarian others focused upon . It gave peculiar feeling warm expectant well-being know many naked boys men idling close side sand dunes . She stretch neck rise pretext see twenty forty undressed males lounging playing ball sunlight . Her body familiar unremarkable thing puzzled convulsive ecstasy men could take , intense amusing need merely touch , reach urgently press , squeeze , pinch , rub . She understand Yossarian ’ lust ; willing take word . Evenings Yossarian felt horny brought Nurse Duckett beach two blankets enjoyed making love clothes sometimes enjoyed making love vigorous bare amoral girls Rome . Frequently went beach night make love , lay shivering blankets ward brisk , damp chill . The ink-black nights turning cold , stars frosty fewer . The raft swayed ghostly trail moonlight seemed sailing away . A marked hint cold weather penetrated air . Other men starting build stoves came Yossarian ’ tent day marvel Orr ’ workmanship . It thrilled Nurse Duckett rapturously Yossarian could keep hands together , although would let slip inside bathing shorts day anyone near enough see , even witness Nurse Cramer , sat side sand dune reproving nose air pretended see anything . Nurse Cramer stopped speaking Nurse Duckett , best friend , liaison Yossarian , still went everywhere Nurse Duckett since Nurse Duckett best friend . She approve Yossarian friends . When stood went swimming Nurse Duckett , Nurse Cramer stood went swimming , , maintaining ten-yard distance , maintaining silence , snubbing even water . When laughed splashed , laughed splashed ; dived , dived ; swam sand bar rested , Nurse Cramer swam sand bar rested . When came , came , dried shoulders towel seated aloofly spot , back rigid ring reflected sunlight burnishing light-blond hair like halo . Nurse Cramer prepared begin talking Nurse Duckett repented apologized . Nurse Duckett preferred things way . For long time wanted give Nurse Cramer rap make shut . Nurse Duckett found Yossarian wonderful already trying change . She loved watch taking short naps face arm thrown across , staring bleakly endless tame , quiet waves breaking like pet puppy dogs shore , scampering lightly sand foot two trotting away . She calm silences . She knew bore , buffed painted fingernails studiously dozed brooded desultory warm afternoon breeze vibrated delicately surface beach . She loved look wide , long , sinewy back bronzed , unblemished skin . She loved bring flame instantly taking whole ear mouth suddenly running hand front way . She loved make burn suffer till dark , satisfy . Then kiss adoringly brought bliss . Yossarian never lonely Nurse Duckett , really know keep mouth shut capricious enough . He haunted tormented vast , boundless ocean . He wondered mournfully , Nurse Duckett buffed nails , people died water . There surely million already . Where ? What insects eaten flesh ? He imagined awful impotence breathing helplessly quarts quarts water . Yossarian followed small fishing boats military launches plying back forth far found unreal ; seem true full-sized men aboard , going somewhere every time . He looked toward stony Elba , eyes automatically searched overhead fluffy , white , turnip-shaped cloud Clevinger vanished . He peered vaporous Italian skyline thought Orr . Clevinger Orr . Where gone ? Yossarian stood jetty dawn watched tufted round log drifting toward tide turn unexpectedly bloated face drowned man ; first dead person ever seen . He thirsted life reached ravenously grasp hold Nurse Duckett ’ flesh . He studied every floating object fearfully gruesome sign Clevinger Orr , prepared morbid shock shock McWatt gave one day plane came blasting suddenly sight distant stillness hurtled mercilessly along shore line great growling , clattering roar bobbing raft blond , pale Kid Sampson , naked sides scrawny even far away , leaped clownishly touch exact moment arbitrary gust wind minor miscalculation McWatt ’ senses dropped speeding plane low enough propeller slice half away . Even people remembered vividly exactly happened next . There briefest , softest tsst ! filtering audibly shattering , overwhelming howl plane ’ engines , Kid Sampson ’ two pale , skinny legs , still joined strings somehow bloody truncated hips , standing stock-still raft seemed full minute two toppled backward water finally faint , echoing splash turned completely upside grotesque toes plaster-white soles Kid Sampson ’ feet remained view . On beach , hell broke loose . Nurse Cramer materialized thin air suddenly weeping hysterically Yossarian ’ chest Yossarian hugged shoulders soothed . His arm bolstered Nurse Duckett , trembling sobbing , , long , angular face dead white . Everyone beach screaming running , men sounded like women . They scampered things panic , stooping hurriedly looking askance gentle , knee-high wave bubbling though ugly , red , grisly organ like liver lung might come washing right . Those water struggling get , forgetting haste swim , wailing , walking , held back flight viscous , clinging sea though biting wind . Kid Sampson rained . Those spied drops limbs torsos drew back terror revulsion , though trying shrink away odious skins . Everybody ran sluggish stampede , shooting tortured , horrified glances back , filling deep , shadowy , rustling woods frail gasps cries . Yossarian drove stumbling , faltering women frantically , shoving prodding make hurry , raced back curse help Hungry Joe tripped blanket camera case carrying fell forward face mud stream . Back squadron everyone already knew . Men uniform screaming running , standing motionless one spot , rooted awe , like Sergeant Knight Doc Daneeka gravely craned heads upward watched guilty , banking , forlorn airplane McWatt circle circle slowly climb . “ Who ? ” Yossarian shouted anxiously Doc Daneeka ran , breathless limp , somber eyes burning misty , hectic anguish . “ Who ’ plane ? ” “ McWatt , ” said Sergeant Knight . “ He ’ got two new pilots training flight . Doc Daneeka ’ , too. ” “ I ’ right , ” contended Doc Daneeka , strange troubled voice , darting anxious look Sergeant Knight . “ Why ’ come ? ” Yossarian exclaimed despair . “ Why keep going ? ” “ He ’ probably afraid come , ” Sergeant Knight answered , without moving solemn gaze McWatt ’ solitary climbing airplane . “ He knows kind trouble ’ in. ” And McWatt kept climbing higher higher , nosing droning airplane upward evenly slow , oval spiral carried far water headed south far russet foothills circled landing field flying north . He soon five thousand feet . His engines soft whispers . A white parachute popped open suddenly surprising puff . A second parachute popped open minutes later coasted , like first , directly toward clearing landing strip . There motion ground . The plane continued south thirty seconds , following pattern , familiar predictable , McWatt lifted wing banked gracefully around turn . “ Two go , ” said Sergeant Knight . “ McWatt Doc Daneeka. ” “ I ’ right , Sergeant Knight , ” Doc Daneeka told plaintively . “ I ’ plane. ” “ Why ’ jump ? ” Sergeant Knight asked , pleading aloud . “ Why ’ jump ? ” “ It ’ make sense , ” grieved Doc Daneeka , biting lip . “ It ’ make sense. ” But Yossarian understood suddenly McWatt ’ jump , went running uncontrollably whole length squadron McWatt ’ plane , waving arms shouting imploringly come , McWatt , come ; one seemed hear , certainly McWatt , great , choking moan tore Yossarian ’ throat McWatt turned , dipped wings salute , decided oh , well , hell , flew mountain . Colonel Cathcart upset deaths Kid Sampson McWatt raised missions sixty-five . 31 MRS. DANEEKA When Colonel Cathcart learned Doc Daneeka killed McWatt ’ plane , increased number missions seventy . The first person squadron find Doc Daneeka dead Sergeant Towser , informed earlier man control tower Doc Daneeka ’ name passenger pilot ’ manifest McWatt filed taking . Sergeant Towser brushed away tear struck Doc Daneeka ’ name roster squadron personnel . With lips still quivering , rose trudged outside reluctantly break bad news Gus Wes , discreetly avoiding conversation Doc Daneeka moved flight surgeon ’ slight sepulchral figure roosting despondently stool late-afternoon sunlight orderly room medical tent . Sergeant Towser ’ heart heavy ; two dead men hands-Mudd , dead man Yossarian ’ tent ’ even , Doc Daneeka , new dead man squadron , certainly gave every indication proving still thornier administrative problem . Gus Wes listened Sergeant Towser looks stoic surprise said word bereavement anyone else Doc Daneeka came hour afterward temperature taken third time day blood pressure checked . The thermometer registered half degree lower usual subnormal temperature 96.8 . Doc Daneeka alarmed . The fixed , vacant , wooden stares two enlisted men even irritating always . “ Goddammit , ” expostulated politely uncommon excess exasperation , “ ’ matter two men anyway ? It ’ right person low temperature time walk around stuffed nose. ” Doc Daneeka emitted glum , self-pitying sniff strolled disconsolately across tent help aspirin sulphur pills paint throat Argyrol . His downcast face fragile forlorn swallow ’ , rubbed back arms rhythmically . “ Just look cold I right . You ’ sure ’ holding anything back ? ” “ You ’ dead , sir , ” one two enlisted men explained . Doc Daneeka jerked head quickly resentful distrust . “ What ’ ? ” “ You ’ dead , sir , ” repeated . “ That ’ probably reason always feel cold. ” “ That ’ right , sir . You ’ probably dead time ’ detect it. ” “ What hell talking ? ” Doc Daneeka cried shrilly surging , petrifying sensation onrushing unavoidable disaster . “ It ’ true , sir , ” said one enlisted men . “ The records show went McWatt ’ plane collect flight time . You ’ come parachute , must killed crash. ” “ That ’ right , sir , ” said . “ You ought glad ’ got temperature all. ” Doc Daneeka ’ mind reeling confusion . “ Have gone crazy ? ” demanded . “ I ’ going report whole insubordinate incident Sergeant Towser. ” “ Sergeant Towser ’ one told us , ” said either Gus Wes . “ The War Department ’ even going notify wife. ” Doc Daneeka yelped ran medical tent remonstrate Sergeant Towser , edged away repugnance advised Doc Daneeka remain sight much possible decision could reached relating disposition remains . “ Gee , I guess really dead , ” grieved one enlisted men low , respectful voice . “ I ’ going miss . He pretty wonderful guy , ’ ? ” “ Yeah , sure , ” mourned . “ But I ’ glad little fuck gone . I getting sick tired taking blood pressure time. ” Mrs. Daneeka , Doc Daneeka ’ wife , glad Doc Daneeka gone split peaceful Staten Island night woeful shrieks lamentation learned War Department telegram husband killed action . Women came comfort , husbands paid condolence calls hoped inwardly would soon move another neighborhood spare obligation continuous sympathy . The poor woman totally distraught almost full week . Slowly , heroically , found strength contemplate future filled dire problems children . Just growing resigned loss , postman rang bolt blue-a letter overseas signed husband ’ signature urged frantically disregard bad news concerning . Mrs. Daneeka dumbfounded . The date letter illegible . The handwriting throughout shaky hurried , style resembled husband ’ melancholy , self-pitying tone familiar , although dreary usual . Mrs. Daneeka overjoyed wept irrepressibly relief kissed crinkled , grubby tissue V-mail stationery thousand times . She dashed grateful note husband pressing details sent wire informing War Department error . The War Department replied touchily error undoubtedly victim sadistic psychotic forger husband ’ squadron . The letter husband returned unopened , stamped KILLED IN ACTION . Mrs. Daneeka widowed cruelly , time grief mitigated somewhat notification Washington sole beneficiary husband ’ $ 10,000 GI insurance policy , amount obtainable demand . The realization children faced immediately starvation brought brave smile face marked turning point distress . The Veterans Administration informed mail next day would entitled pension benefits rest natural life husband ’ demise , burial allowance $ 250 . A government check $ 250 enclosed . Gradually , inexorably , prospects brightened . A letter arrived week Social Security Administration stating , provisions Old Age Survivors Insurance Act Of 1935 , would receive monthly support dependent children reached age eighteen , burial allowance $ 250 . With government letters proof death , applied payment three life insurance policies Doc Daneeka carried , value $ 50,000 ; claim honored processed swiftly . Each day brought new unexpected treasures . A key safe-deposit box led fourth life insurance policy face value $ 50,000 , $ 18,000 cash income tax never paid need never paid . A fraternal lodge belonged gave cemetery plot . A second fraternal organization member sent burial allowance $ 250 . His county medical association gave burial allowance $ 250 . The husbands closest friends began flirt . Mrs. Daneeka simply delighted way things turning hair dyed . Her fantastic wealth kept piling , remind daily hundreds thousands dollars acquiring worth single penny without husband share good fortune . It astonished many separate organizations willing much bury Doc Daneeka , , back Pianosa , terrible time trying keep head ground wondered dismal apprehension wife answer letter written .

Instead busting heads open , tramped galoshes black raincoat drizzling darkness invite Chief White Halfoat move , , drive fastidious , clean-living bastards threats swinish habits . But Chief White Halfoat felt cold already making plans move hospital die pneumonia . Instinct told Chief White Halfoat almost time . His chest ached coughed chronically . Whiskey longer warmed . Most damning , Captain Flume moved back trailer . Here omen unmistakable meaning . “ He move back , ” Yossarian argued vain effort cheer glum , barrel-chested Indian , whose well-knit sorrel-red face degenerated rapidly dilapidated , calcareous gray . “ He ’ die exposure tried live woods weather. ” “ No , ’ drive yellowbelly back , ” Chief White Halfoat disagreed obstinately .

It ’ lousy Dr. Stubbs ’ fault , getting Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn stirred flight surgeons . He ’ going give medical profession bad name standing principle . If ’ careful , ’ black-balled state medical association kept hospitals. ” Yossarian watched Chief White Halfoat pour whiskey carefully three empty shampoo bottles store away musette bag packing . “ Can ’ stop tent way hospital punch one nose ? ” speculated aloud . “ I ’ got four , ’ going crowd tent altogether. ” “ You know , something like happened whole tribe , ” Chief White Halfoat remarked jolly appreciation , sitting back cot chuckle . “ Why ’ get Captain Black kick kids ?

Even dark , young soldiers pasty white faces throwing everywhere passing drunkenly ground . The air turned foul . Other men picked steam hours passed , aimless , riotous celebration continued . It raw , violent , guzzling saturnalia spilled obstreperously woods officers ’ club spread hills toward hospital antiaircraft-gun emplacements . There fist fights squadron one stabbing . Corporal Kolodny shot leg intelligence tent playing loaded gun gums toes painted purple speeding ambulance lay back blood spurting wound . Men cut fingers , bleeding heads , stomach cramps broken ankles came limping penitently medical tent gums toes painted purple Gus Wes given laxative throw bushes . The joyous celebration lasted long night , stillness fractured often wild , exultant shouts cries people merry sick . There recurring sound retching moaning , laughter , greetings , threats swearing , bottles shattering rock . There dirty songs distance . It worse New Year ’ Eve . Yossarian went bed early safety soon dreamed fleeing almost headlong endless wooden staircase , making loud , staccato clatter heels . Then woke little realized someone shooting machine gun . A tortured , terrified sob rose throat . His first thought Milo attacking squadron , rolled cot floor lay underneath trembling , praying ball , heart thumping like drop forge , body bathed cold sweat . There noise planes . A drunken , happy laugh sounded afar . “ Happy New Year , Happy New Year ! ” triumphant familiar voice shouted hilariously high short , sharp bursts machine gun fire , Yossarian understood men gone prank one sandbagged machine-gun emplacements Milo installed hills raid squadron staffed men . Yossarian blazed hatred wrath saw victim irresponsible joke destroyed sleep reduced whimpering hulk . He wanted kill , wanted murder . He angrier ever , angrier even slid hands around McWatt ’ neck strangle . The gun opened fire . Voices cried “ Happy New Year ! ” gloating laughter rolled hills darkness like witch ’ glee . In moccasins coveralls , Yossarian charged tent revenge his.45 , ramming clip cartridges grip slamming bolt gun back load . He snapped safety catch ready shoot . He heard Nately running restrain , calling name . The machine gun opened fire black rise motor pool , orange tracer bullets skimmed like low-gliding dashes tops shadowy tents , almost clipping peaks . Roars rough laughter rang short bursts . Yossarian felt resentment boil like acid inside ; endangering life , bastards ! With blind , ferocious rage determination , raced across squadron past motor pool , running fast could , already pounding hills along narrow , winding path Nately finally caught , still calling “ Yo-Yo ! Yo-Yo ! ” pleading concern imploring stop . He grasped Yossarian ’ shoulders tried hold back . Yossarian twisted free , turning . Nately reached , Yossarian drove fist squarely Nately ’ delicate young face hard could , cursing , drew arm back hit , Nately dropped sight groan lay curled ground head buried hands blood streaming fingers . Yossarian whirled plunged ahead path without looking back . Soon saw machine gun . Two figures leaped silhouette heard fled night taunting laughter could get . He late . Their footsteps receded , leaving circle sandbags empty silent crisp windless moonlight . He looked dejectedly . Jeering laughter came , distance . A twig snapped nearby . Yossarian dropped knees cold thrill elation aimed . He heard stealthy rustle leaves side sandbags fired two quick rounds . Someone fired back , recognized shot . “ Dunbar ? called . “ Yossarian ? ” The two men left hiding places walked forward meet clearing weary disappointment , guns . They shivering slightly frosty air wheezing labor uphill rush . “ The bastards , ” said Yossarian . “ They got away. ” “ They took ten years life , ” Dunbar exclaimed . “ I thought son bitch Milo bombing us . I ’ never scared . I wish I knew bastards . “ One Sergeant Knight. ” “ Let ’ go kill him. ” Dunbar ’ teeth chattering . “ He right scare us way. ” Yossarian longer wanted kill anyone . “ Let ’ help Nately first . I think I hurt bottom hill. ” But sign Nately along path , even though Yossarian located right spot blood stones . Nately tent either , catch next morning checked hospital patients learning checked broken nose night . Nately beamed frightened surprise padded ward slippers robes behind Nurse Cramer assigned beds . Nately ’ nose bulky cast , two black eyes . He kept blushing giddily shy embarrassment saying sorry Yossarian came apologize hitting . Yossarian felt terrible ; could hardly bear look Nately ’ battered countenance , even though sight comical tempted guffaw . Dunbar disgusted sentimentality , three relieved Hungry Joe came barging unexpectedly intricate black camera trumped-up symptoms appendicitis near enough Yossarian take pictures feeling Nurse Duckett . Like Yossarian , soon disappointed . Nurse Duckett decided marry doctor-any doctor , well business-and would take chances vicinity man might someday husband . Hungry Joe irate inconsolable until-of people-the chaplain led wearing maroon corduroy bathrobe , shining like skinny lighthouse radiant grin self-satisfaction tremendous concealed . The chaplain entered hospital pain heart doctors thought gas stomach advanced case Wisconsin shingles . “ What world Wisconsin shingles ? ” asked Yossarian . “ That ’ doctors wanted know ! ” blurted chaplain proudly , burst laughter . No one ever seen waggish , happy . “ There ’ thing Wisconsin shingles . Don ’ understand ? I lied . I made deal doctors . I promised I would let know Wisconsin shingles went away would promise anything cure . I never told lie . Isn ’ wonderful ? ” The chaplain sinned , good . Common sense told telling lies defecting duty sins . On hand , everyone knew sin evil , good could come evil . But feel good ; felt positively marvelous . Consequently , followed logically telling lies defecting duty could sins . The chaplain mastered , moment divine intuition , handy technique protective rationalization , exhilarated discovery . It miraculous . It almost trick , saw , turn vice virtue slander truth , impotence abstinence , arrogance humility , plunder philanthropy , thievery honor , blasphemy wisdom , brutality patriotism , sadism justice . Anybody could ; required brains . It merely required character . With effervescent agility chaplain ran whole gamut orthodox immoralities , Nately sat bed flushed elation , astounded mad gang companions found nucleus . He flattered apprehensive , certain severe official would soon appear throw whole lot like pack bums . No one bothered . In evening trooped exuberantly see lousy Hollywood extravaganza Technicolor , trooped exuberantly back lousy Hollywood extravaganza , soldier white , Dunbar screamed went pieces . “ He ’ back ! ” Dunbar screamed . “ He ’ back ! He ’ back ! ” Yossarian froze tracks , paralyzed much eerie shrillness Dunbar ’ voice familiar , white , morbid sight soldier white covered head toe plaster gauze . A strange , quavering , involuntary noise came bubbling Yossarian ’ throat . “ He ’ back ! ” Dunbar screamed . “ He ’ back ! ” patient delirious fever echoed automatic terror . All ward erupted bedlam . Mobs sick injured men began ranting incoherently running jumping aisle though building fire . A patient one foot one crutch hopping back forth swiftly panic crying , “ What ? What ? Are burning ? Are burning ? ” “ He ’ back ! ” someone shouted . “ Didn ’ hear ? He ’ back ! He ’ back ! ” “ Who ’ back ? ” shouted someone else . “ Who ? ” “ What mean ? What ? ” “ Are fire ? ” “ Get run , damn ! Everybody get run ! ” Everybody got bed began running one end ward . One C.I.D . man looking gun shoot one C.I.D . men jabbed elbow eye . The ward turned chaos . The patient delirious high fever leaped aisle almost knocked patient one foot , accidentally brought black rubber tip crutch ’ bare foot , crushing toes . The delirious man fever crushed toes sank floor wept pain men tripped hurt blind , milling , agonized stampede . “ He ’ back ! ” men kept mumbling chanting calling hysterically rushed back forth . “ He ’ back , ’ back ! ” Nurse Cramer middle suddenly like spinning policeman , trying desperately restore order , dissolving helplessly tears failed . “ Be still , please still , ” urged uselessly massive sobs . The chaplain , pale ghost , idea going . Neither Nately , kept close Yossarian ’ side , clinging elbow , Hungry Joe , followed dubiously scrawny fists clenched glanced side side face scared . “ Hey , ’ going ? ” Hungry Joe pleaded . “ What hell going ? ” “ It ’ one ! ” Dunbar shouted emphatically voice rising clearly raucous commotion . “ Don ’ understand ? It ’ one. ” “ The one ! ” Yossarian heard echo , quivering deep ominous excitement could control , shoved way Dunbar toward bed soldier white . “ Take easy , fellas , ” short patriotic Texan counseled affably , uncertain grin . “ There ’ cause upset . Why ’ take easy ? ” “ The one ! ” others began murmuring , chanting shouting . Suddenly Nurse Duckett , . “ What ’ going ? ” demanded . “ He ’ back ! ” Nurse Cramer screamed , sinking arms . “ He ’ back , ’ back ! ” It , indeed , man . He lost inches added weight , Yossarian remembered instantly two stiff anus two stiff , thick , useless legs drawn upward air almost perpendicularly taut ropes long lead weights suspended pulleys frayed black hole bandages mouth . He , fact , hardly changed . There zinc pipe rising hard stone mass groin leading clear glass jar floor . There clear glass jar pole dripping fluid crook elbow . Yossarian would recognize anywhere . He wondered . “ There ’ one inside ! ” Dunbar yelled unexpectedly . Yossarian felt heart skip beat legs grow weak . “ What talking ? ” shouted dread , stunned haggard , sparking anguish Dunbar ’ eyes crazed look wild shock horror . “ Are nuts something ? What hell mean , ’ one inside ? ” “ They ’ stolen away ! ” Dunbar shouted back . “ He ’ hollow inside , like chocolate soldier . They took away left bandages there. ” “ Why ? ” “ Why anything ? ” “ They ’ stolen away ! ” screamed someone else , people ward began screaming , “ They ’ stolen away . They ’ stolen away ! ” “ Go back beds , ” Nurse Duckett pleaded Dunbar Yossarian , pushing feebly Yossarian ’ chest . “ Please go back beds. ” “ You ’ crazy ! ” Yossarian shouted angrily Dunbar . “ What hell makes say ? ” “ Did anyone see ? ” Dunbar demanded sneering fervor . “ You saw , ’ ? ” Yossarian said Nurse Duckett . “ Tell Dunbar ’ someone inside. ” “ Lieutenant Schmulker inside , ” Nurse Duckett said . “ He ’ burned over. ” “ Did see ? ” “ You saw , ’ ? ” “ The doctor bandaged saw him. ” “ Go get , ? Which doctor ? ” Nurse Duckett reacted question startled gasp . “ The doctor ’ even ! ” exclaimed . “ The patient brought us way field hospital. ” “ You see ? ” cried Nurse Cramer . “ There ’ one inside ! ” “ There ’ one inside ! ” yelled Hungry Joe , began stamping floor . Dunbar broke leaped furiously soldier white ’ bed see , pressing gleaming eye hungrily tattered black hole shell white bandages . He still bent staring one eye lightless , unstirring void soldier white ’ mouth doctors M.P.s came running help Yossarian pull away . The doctors wore guns waist . The guards carried carbines rifles shoved jolted crowd muttering patients back . A stretcher wheels , solder white lifted bed skillfully rolled sight matter seconds . The doctors M.P.s moved ward assuring everyone everything right . Nurse Duckett plucked Yossarian ’ arm whispered furtively meet broom closet outside corridor . Yossarian rejoiced heard .

He would never watch another fist fight without fearing going faint crack skull open pavement suffer fatal heart attack cerebral hemorrhage . He wondered would ever see wife three small children . He wondered ever see wife , Captain Black planted mind strong doubts fidelity character women . There many men , felt , could prove satisfying sexually . When thought death , always thought wife , thought wife always thought losing . In another minute chaplain felt strong enough rise walk glum reluctance tent next door Sergeant Whitcomb .

A whimpering sound rose chaplain ’ throat , jaw began quiver . His eyes filled tears , crying . He started toward Yossarian tiptoe mourn beside share wordless grief . At moment hand grabbed roughly around arm brusque voice demanded , “ Chaplain Shipman ? ” He turned surprise face stout , pugnacious colonel large head mustache smooth , florid skin . He never seen man . “ Yes . What ? ” The fingers grasping chaplain ’ arm hurting , tried vain squirm loose . “ Come along. ” The chaplain pulled back frightened confusion . “ Where ? Why ?

The notion came holding blame mid-air crash death Nately . “ What I done ? ” “ Why ’ keep trap shut let us ask questions ? ” said colonel . “ Don ’ talk way , ” said major . “ It ’ necessary disrespectful. ” “ Then tell keep trap shut let us ask questions. ” “ Father , please keep trap shut let us ask questions , ” urged major sympathetically . “ It better you. ” “ It ’ necessary call Father , ” said chaplain . “ I ’ Catholic. ” “ Neither I , Father , ” said major . “ It ’ I ’ devout person , I like call men God Father. ” “ He ’ even believe atheists foxholes , ” colonel mocked , nudged chaplain ribs familiarly . “ Go , Chaplain , tell . Are atheists foxholes ? ” “ I ’ know , sir , ” chaplain replied . “ I ’ never foxhole. ” The officer front swung head around swiftly quarrelsome expression . “ You ’ never heaven either , ? But know ’ heaven , ’ ? ” “ Or ? ” said colonel . “ That ’ serious crime ’ committed , Father , ” said major . “ What crime ? ” “ We ’ know yet , ” said colonel . “ But ’ going find .

The major picked length rubber hose began tapping menacingly open palm . The colonel lifted box matches , took one held poised striking surface , watching glowering eyes chaplain ’ next sign defiance . The chaplain pale almost petrified move . The bright glare spotlight made turn away finally ; dripping water louder almost unbearably irritating . He wished would tell wanted would know confess . He waited tensely third officer , signal colonel , ambled wall seated table inches away chaplain . His face expressionless , eyes penetrating cold . “ Turn light , ” said shoulder low , calm voice . “ It ’ annoying. ” The chaplain gave small smile gratitude . “ Thank , sir .

One minute living , one minute dead. ” “ But ’ dead ! ” Yossarian cried , ready argue insistently . But course knew true , knew logical true ; old man marched along majority . Yossarian turned away trudged apartment gloomy scowl , peering pessimistic curiosity rooms . Everything made glass smashed men clubs . Torn drapes bedding lay dumped floor . Chairs , tables dressers overturned . Everything breakable broken . The destruction total . No wild vandals could thorough . Every window smashed , darkness poured like inky clouds room shattered panes . Yossarian could imagine heavy , crashing footfalls tall M.P.s hard white hats . He could picture fiery malicious exhilaration made wreckage , sanctimonious , ruthless sense right dedication . All poor young girls gone . Everyone gone weeping old woman bulky brown gray sweaters black head shawl , soon would gone . “ Gone , ” grieved , walked back , could even speak . “ Who take care ? ” Yossarian ignored question . “ Nately ’ girl friend-did anyone hear ? ” asked . “ Gone. ” “ I know ’ gone . But anyone hear ? Does anyone know ? ” “ Gone. ” “ The little sister .

Catch-22 exist , positive , made difference . What matter everyone thought existed , much worse , object text ridicule refute , accuse , criticize , attack , amend , hate , revile , spit , rip shreds , trample upon burn . It cold outside , dark , leaky , insipid mist lay swollen air trickled large , unpolished stone blocks houses pedestals monuments . Yossarian hurried back Milo recanted . He said sorry , knowing lying , promised fly many missions Colonel Cathcart wanted Milo would use influence Rome help locate Nately ’ whore ’ kid sister . “ She ’ twelve-year-old virgin , Milo , ” explained anxiously , “ I want find ’ late. ” Milo responded request benign smile . “ I ’ got twelve-year-old virgin ’ looking , ” announced jubilantly . “ This twelve-year-old virgin really thirty-four , brought low-protein diet strict parents ’ start sleeping men until- “ “ Milo , I ’ talking little girl ! ” Yossarian interrupted desperate impatience . “ Don ’ understand ?

You ’ got principles . Certainly I ’ got daughters , I know exactly ’ talking . We ’ find girl turn whole city upside . Come along. ” Yossarian went along Milo Minderbinder ’ speeding M amp ; M staff car police headquarters meet swarthy , untidy police commissioner narrow black mustache unbuttoned tunic fiddling stout woman warts two chins entered office greeted Milo warm surprise bowed scraped obscene servility though Milo elegant marquis . “ Ah , Marchese Milo , ” declared effusive pleasure , pushing fat , disgruntled woman door without even looking toward . “ Why ’ tell coming ? I would big party . Come , come , Marchese . You almost never visit us more. ” Milo knew one moment waste . “ Hello , Luigi , ” said , nodding briskly almost seemed rude . “ Luigi , I need help . My friend wants find girl. ” “ A girl , Marchese ? ” said Luigi , scratching face pensively . “ There lots girls Rome . For American officer , girl difficult. ” “ No , Luigi , ’ understand . This twelve-year-old virgin find right away. ” “ Ah , yes , I understand , ” Luigi said sagaciously . “ A virgin might take little time . But waits bus terminal young farm girls looking work arrive , I- “ “ Luigi , still ’ understand , ” Milo snapped brusque impatience police commissioner ’ face flushed jumped attention began buttoning uniform confusion . “ This girl friend , old friend family , want help .

Will help ? ” “ Si , Marchese , I understand , ” said Luigi . “ And I everything power find . But tonight I almost men . Tonight men busy trying break traffic illegal tobacco. ” “ Illegal tobacco ? ” asked Milo . “ Milo , ” Yossarian bleated faintly sinking heart , sensing lost . “ Si , Marchese , ” said Luigi . “ The profit illegal tobacco high smuggling almost impossible control. ” “ Is really much profit illegal tobacco ? ” Milo inquired keen interest , rust-colored eyebrows arching avidly nostrils sniffing . “ Milo , ” Yossarian called . “ Pay attention , ? ” “ Si , Marchese , ” Luigi answered . “ The profit illegal tobacco high . The smuggling national scandal , Marchese , truly national disgrace. ” “ Is fact ? ” Milo observed preoccupied smile started toward door though spell . “ Milo ! ” Yossarian yelled , bounded forward impulsively intercept . “ Milo , ’ got help me. ” “ Illegal tobacco , ” Milo explained look epileptic lust , struggling doggedly get . “ Let go . I ’ got smuggle illegal tobacco. ” “ Stay help find , ” pleaded Yossarian . “ You smuggle illegal tobacco tomorrow. ” But Milo deaf kept pushing forward , nonviolently irresistibly , sweating , eyes , though grip blind fixation , burning feverishly , twitching mouth slavering . He moaned calmly though remote , instinctive distress kept repeating , “ Illegal tobacco , illegal tobacco. ” Yossarian stepped way resignation finally saw hopeless try reason . Milo gone like shot . The commissioner police unbuttoned tunic looked Yossarian contempt . “ What want ? ” asked coldly . “ Do want arrest ? ” Yossarian walked office stairs dark , tomblike street , passing hall stout woman warts two chins , already way back . There sign Milo outside . There lights windows . The deserted sidewalk rose steeply continuously several blocks . He could see glare broad avenue top long cobblestone incline . The police station almost bottom ; yellow bulbs entrance sizzled dampness like wet torches . A frigid , fine rain falling . He began walking slowly , pushing uphill . Soon came quiet , cozy , inviting restaurant red velvet drapes windows blue neon sign near door said : TONY ’ RESTAURANT FINE FOOD AND DRINK . KEEP OUT . The words blue neon sign surprised mildly instant . Nothing warped seemed bizarre strange , distorted surroundings . The tops sheer buildings slanted weird , surrealistic perspective , street seemed tilted . He raised collar warm woolen coat hugged around . The night raw . A boy thin shirt thin tattered trousers walked darkness bare feet . The boy black hair needed haircut shoes socks . His sickly face pale sad . His feet made grisly , soft , sucking sounds rain puddles wet pavement passed , Yossarian moved intense pity poverty wanted smash pale , sad , sickly face fist knock existence brought mind pale , sad , sickly children Italy night needed haircuts needed shoes socks . He made Yossarian think cripples cold hungry men women , dumb , passive , devout mothers catatonic eyes nursing infants outdoors night chilled animal udders bared insensibly raw rain . Cows . Almost cue , nursing mother padded past holding infant black rags , Yossarian wanted smash , reminded barefoot boy thin shirt thin , tattered trousers shivering , stupefying misery world never yet provided enough heat food justice ingenious unscrupulous handful . What lousy earth ! He wondered many people destitute night even prosperous country , many homes shanties , many husbands drunk wives socked , many children bullied , abused abandoned . How many families hungered food could afford buy ? How many hearts broken ? How many suicides would take place night , many people would go insane ? How many cockroaches landlords would triumph ? How many winners losers , successes failures , rich men poor men ? How many wise guys stupid ? How many happy endings unhappy endings ? How many honest men liars , brave men cowards , loyal men traitors , many sainted men corrupt , many people positions trust sold souls blackguards petty cash , many never souls ? How many straight-and-narrow paths crooked paths ? How many best families worst families many good people bad people ? When added subtracted , might left children , perhaps Albert Einstein old violinist sculptor somewhere . Yossarian walked lonely torture , feeling estranged , could wipe mind excruciating image barefoot boy sickly cheeks turned corner avenue finally came upon Allied soldier convulsions ground , young lieutenant small , pale , boyish face . Six soldiers different countries wrestled different parts , striving help hold still . He yelped groaned unintelligibly clenched teeth , eyes rolled head . “ Don ’ let bite tongue , ” short sergeant near Yossarian advised shrewdly , seventh man threw fray wrestle ill lieutenant ’ face . All wrestlers turned undecidedly , held young lieutenant rigid know . A quiver moronic panic spread one straining brute face another . “ Why ’ lift put hood car ? ” corporal standing back Yossarian drawled . That seemed make sense , seven men lifted young lieutenant stretched carefully hood parked car , still pinning struggling part . Once stretched hood parked car , stared uneasily , idea next . “ Why ’ lift hood car lay ground ? ” drawled corporal behind Yossarian . That seemed like good idea , , began move back sidewalk , could finish , jeep raced flashing red spotlight side two military policemen front seat . “ What ’ going ? ” driver yelled . “ He ’ convulsions , ” one men grappling one young lieutenant ’ limbs answered . “ We ’ holding still. ” “ That ’ good . He ’ arrest. ” “ What ? ” “ Keep arrest ! ” M.P . shouted , doubling raucous laughter jest , sped away jeep . Yossarian recalled leave papers moved prudently past strange group toward sound muffled voices emanating distance inside murky darkness ahead . The broad , rain-blotched boulevard illuminated every half-block short , curling lampposts eerie , shimmering glares surrounded smoky brown mist . From window overhead heard unhappy female voice pleading , “ Please ’ . Please ’ t. ” A despondent young woman black raincoat much black hair face passed eyes lowered . At Ministry Public Affairs next block , drunken lady backed one fluted Corinthian columns drunken young soldier , three drunken comrades arms sat watching nearby steps wine bottles standing legs . “ Pleeshe ’ , ” begged drunken lady . “ I want go home . Pleeshe ’ t. ” One sitting men cursed pugnaciously hurled wine bottle Yossarian turned look . The bottle shattered harmlessly far away brief muted noise . Yossarian continued walking away listless , unhurried pace , hands buried pockets . “ Come , baby , ” heard drunken soldier urge determinedly . “ It ’ turn now. ” “ Pleeshe ’ , ” begged drunken lady . “ Pleeshe ’ t. ” At next corner , deep inside dense , impenetrable shadows narrow , winding side street , heard mysterious , unmistakable sound someone shoveling snow . The measured , labored , evocative scrape iron shovel concrete made flesh crawl terror stepped curb cross ominous alley hurried onward haunting , incongruous noise left behind . Now knew : soon , continued without turning , would come dry fountain middle boulevard , officers ’ apartment seven blocks beyond . He heard snarling , inhuman voices cutting ghostly blackness front suddenly . The bulb corner lamp post died , spilling gloom half street , throwing everything visible balance . On side intersection , man beating dog stick like man beating horse whip Raskolnikov ’ dream . Yossarian strained helplessly see hear . The dog whimpered squealed brute , dumbfounded hysteria end old Manila rope groveled crawled belly without resisting , man beat beat anyway heavy , flat stick . A small crowd watched . A squat woman stepped asked please stop . “ Mind business , ” man barked gruffly , lifting stick though might beat , woman retreated sheepishly abject humiliated air . Yossarian quickened pace get away , almost ran . The night filled horrors , thought knew Christ must felt walked world , like psychiatrist ward full nuts , like victim prison full thieves . What welcome sight leper must ! At next corner man beating small boy brutally midst immobile crowd adult spectators made effort intervene . Yossarian recoiled sickening recognition . He certain witnessed horrible scene sometime . Déjà vu ? The sinister coincidence shook filled doubt dread . It scene witnessed block , although everything seemed quite different . What world happening ? Would squat woman step ask man please stop ? Would raise hand strike would retreat ? Nobody moved . The child cried steadily though drugged misery . The man kept knocking hard , resounding open-palm blows head , jerking feet order knock . No one sullen , cowering crowd seemed care enough stunned beaten boy interfere . The child nine . One drab woman weeping silently dirty dish towel . The boy emaciated needed haircut . Bright-red blood streaming ears . Yossarian crossed quickly side immense avenue escape nauseating sight found walking human teeth lying drenched , glistening pavement near splotches blood kept sticky pelting raindrops poking one like sharp fingernails . Molars broken incisors lay scattered everywhere . He circled tiptoe grotesque debris came near doorway containing crying soldier holding saturated handkerchief mouth , supported sagged two soldiers waiting grave impatience military ambulance finally came clanging amber fog lights passed altercation next block civilian Italian books slew civilian policemen armlocks clubs . The screaming , struggling civilian dark man face white flour fear . His eyes pulsating hectic desperation , flapping like bat ’ wings , many tall policemen seized arms legs lifted . His books spilled ground . “ Help ! ” shrieked shrilly voice strangling emotion , policemen carried open doors rear ambulance threw inside . “ Police ! Help ! Police ! ” The doors shut bolted , ambulance raced away . There humorless irony ludicrous panic man screaming help police policemen around . Yossarian smiled wryly futile ridiculous cry aid , saw start words ambiguous , realized alarm , perhaps , intended call police heroic warning grave doomed friend everyone policeman club gun mob policemen clubs guns back . “ Help ! Police ! ” man cried , could shouting danger . Yossarian responded thought slipping away stealthily police almost tripped feet burly woman forty hastening across intersection guiltily , darting furtive , vindictive glances behind toward woman eighty thick , bandaged ankles doddering losing pursuit . The old woman gasping breath minced along muttering distracted agitation . There mistaking nature scene ; chase . The triumphant first woman halfway across wide avenue second woman reached curb . The nasty , small , gloating smile glanced back laboring old woman wicked apprehensive . Yossarian knew could help troubled old woman would cry , knew could spring forward capture sturdy first woman hold mob policemen nearby second woman would give license shriek distress . But old woman passed without even seeing , mumbling terrible , tragic vexation , soon first woman vanished deepening layers darkness old woman left standing helplessly center thoroughfare , dazed , uncertain way proceed , alone . Yossarian tore eyes hurried away shame done nothing assist . He darted furtive , guilty glances back fled defeat , afraid old woman might start following , welcomed concealing shelter drizzling , drifting , lightless , nearly opaque gloom . Mobs… mobs policemen-everything England hands mobs , mobs , mobs . Mobs clubs control everywhere . The surface collar shoulders Yossarian ’ coat soaked . His socks wet cold . The light next lamppost , , glass globe broken . Buildings featureless shapes flowed noiselessly though borne past immutably surface rank timeless tide . A tall monk passed , face buried entirely inside coarse gray cowl , even eyes hidden . Footsteps sloshed toward steadily puddle , feared would another barefoot child . He brushed gaunt , cadaverous , tristful man black raincoat star-shaped scar cheek glossy mutilated depression size egg one temple . On squishing straw sandals , young woman materialized whole face disfigured God-awful pink piebald burn started neck stretched raw , corrugated mass cheeks past eyes ! Yossarian could bear look , shuddered . No one would ever love . His spirit sick ; longed lie girl could love would soothe excite put sleep . A mob club waiting Pianosa . The girls gone . The countess daughter-in-law longer good enough ; grown old fun , longer time . Luciana gone , dead , probably ; yet , soon enough . Aarfy ’ buxom trollop vanished smutty cameo ring , Nurse Duckett ashamed refused fly combat missions would cause scandal . The girl knew nearby plain maid officers ’ apartment , none men ever slept . Her name Michaela , men called filthy things dulcet , ingratiating voices , giggled childish joy understood English thought flattering making harmless jokes . Everything wild watched filled enchanted delight . She happy , simple-minded , hard-working girl could read barely able write name . Her straight hair color rotting straw . She sallow skin myopic eyes , none men ever slept none men ever wanted , none Aarfy , raped evening held prisoner clothes closet almost two hours hand mouth civilian curfew sirens sounded unlawful outside . Then threw window . Her dead body still lying pavement Yossarian arrived pushed way politely circle solemn neighbors dim lanterns , glared venom shrank away pointed bitterly toward second-floor windows private , grim , accusing conversations . Yossarian ’ heart pounded fright horror pitiful , ominous , gory spectacle broken corpse . He ducked hallway bolted stairs apartment , found Aarfy pacing uneasily pompous , slightly uncomfortable smile . Aarfy seemed bit unsettled fidgeted pipe assured Yossarian everything going right . There nothing worry . “ I raped , ” explained . Yossarian aghast . “ But killed , Aarfy ! You killed ! ” “ Oh , I I raped , ” Aarfy replied condescending manner . “ I ’ well let go around saying bad things us , could I ? ” “ But touch , dumb bastard ? ” Yossarian shouted . “ Why ’ get girl street wanted one ? The city full prostitutes. ” “ Oh , , , ” Aarfy bragged . “ I never paid life. ” “ Aarfy , insane ? ” Yossarian almost speechless . “ You killed girl . They ’ going put jail ! ” “ Oh , , ” Aarfy answered forced smile . “ Not . They ’ going put good old Aarfy jail . Not killing her. ” “ But threw window . She ’ lying dead street. ” “ She right , ” Aarfy answered . “ It ’ curfew. ” “ Stupid ! Don ’ realize ’ done ? ” Yossarian wanted grab Aarfy well-fed , caterpillar-soft shoulders shake sense . “ You ’ murdered human . They going put jail . They might even hang ! ” “ Oh , I hardly think ’ , ” Aarfy replied jovial chuckle , although symptoms nervousness increased . He spilled tobacco crumbs unconsciously short fingers fumbled bowl pipe . “ No , sirree . Not good old Aarfy. ” He chortled . “ She servant girl . I hardly think ’ going make much fuss one poor Italian servant girl many thousands lives lost every day . Do ? ” “ Listen ! ” Yossarian cried , almost joy . He pricked ears watched blood drain Aarfy ’ face sirens mourned far away , police sirens , ascended almost instantaneously howling , strident , onrushing cacophony overwhelming sound seemed crash room around every side . “ Aarfy , ’ coming , ” said flood compassion , shouting heard noise . “ They ’ coming arrest . Aarfy , ’ understand ? You ’ take life another human get away , even poor servant girl . Don ’ see ? Can ’ understand ? ” “ Oh , , ” Aarfy insisted lame laugh weak smile . “ They ’ coming arrest . Not good old Aarfy. ” All looked sick . He sank chair trembling stupor , stumpy , lax hands quaking lap . Cars skidded stop outside . Spotlights hit windows immediately . Car doors slammed police whistles screeched . Voices rose harshly . Aarfy green . He kept shaking head mechanically queer , numb smile repeating weak , hollow monotone coming , good old Aarfy , sirree , striving convince even heavy footsteps raced stairs pounded across landing , even fists beat door four times deafening , inexorable force . Then door apartment flew open , two large , tough , brawny M.P.s icy eyes firm , sinewy , unsmiling jaws entered quickly , strode across room , arrested Yossarian . They arrested Yossarian Rome without pass . They apologized Aarfy intruding led Yossarian away , gripping arm fingers hard steel manacles . They said nothing way . Two tall M.P.s clubs hard white helmets waiting outside closed car . They marched Yossarian back seat , car roared away weaved rain muddy fog police station . The M.P.s locked night cell four stone walls . At dawn gave pail latrine drove airport , two giant M.P.s clubs white helmets waiting transport plane whose engines already warming arrived , cylindrical green cowlings oozing quivering beads condensation . None M.P.s said anything either . They even nod . Yossarian never seen granite faces . The plane flew Pianosa . Two silent M.P.s waiting landing strip . There eight , filed precise , wordless discipline two cars sped humming tires past four squadron areas Group Headquarters building , still two M.P.s waiting parking area . All ten tall , strong , purposeful , silent men towered around turned toward entrance . Their footsteps crunched loud unison cindered ground . He impression accelerating haste . He terrified . Every one ten M.P.s seemed powerful enough bash death single blow . They press massive , toughened , boulderous shoulders crush life body . There nothing could save . He could even see two gripping arms marched rapidly two tight single-file columns formed . Their pace quickened , felt though flying along feet ground trotted resolute cadence wide marble staircase upper landing , still two inscrutable military policemen hard faces waiting lead even faster pace long , cantilevered balcony overhanging immense lobby . Their marching footsteps dull tile floor thundered like awesome , quickening drum roll vacant center building moved even greater speed precision toward Colonel Cathcart ’ office , violent winds panic began blowing Yossarian ’ ears turned toward doom inside office , Colonel Korn , rump spreading comfortably corner Colonel Cathcart ’ desk , sat waiting greet genial smile said , “ We ’ sending home. ” 40 CATCH-22 There , course , catch . “ Catch-22 ? ” inquired Yossarian . “ Of course , ” Colonel Korn answered pleasantly , chased mighty guard massive M.P.s insouciant flick hand slightly contemptuous nod-most relaxed , always , could cynical . His rimless square eyeglasses glinted sly amusement gazed Yossarian . “ After , ’ simply send home refusing fly missions keep rest men , ? That would hardly fair them. ” “ You ’ goddam right ! ” Colonel Cathcart blurted , lumbering back forth gracelessly like winded bull , puffing pouting angrily . “ I ’ like tie hand foot throw aboard plane every mission . That ’ I ’ like do. ” Colonel Korn motioned Colonel Cathcart silent smiled Yossarian . “ You know , really making things terribly difficult Colonel Cathcart , ” observed flip good humor , though fact displease . “ The men unhappy morale beginning deteriorate . And ’ fault. ” “ It ’ fault , ” Yossarian argued , “ raising number missions. ” “ No , ’ fault refusing fly , ” Colonel Korn retorted . “ The men perfectly content fly many missions asked long thought alternative . Now ’ given hope , ’ unhappy . So blame yours. ” “ Doesn ’ know ’ war going ? ” Colonel Cathcart , still stamping back forth , demanded morosely without looking Yossarian . “ I ’ quite sure , ” Colonel Korn answered . “ That ’ probably refuses fly them. ” “ Doesn ’ make difference ? ” “ Will knowledge ’ war going weaken decision refuse participate ? ” Colonel Korn inquired sarcastic seriousness , mocking Colonel Cathcart . “ No , sir , ” Yossarian replied , almost returning Colonel Korn ’ smile . “ I afraid , ” Colonel Korn remarked elaborate sigh , locking fingers together comfortably top smooth , bald , broad , shiny brown head . “ You know , fairness , really ’ treated badly , ? We ’ fed paid time . We gave medal even made captain. ” “ I never made captain , ” Colonel Cathcart exclaimed bitterly . “ I given court-martial loused Ferrara mission went around twice. ” “ I told promote , ” said Colonel Korn , “ ’ listen me. ” “ No ’ . You told promote , ’ ? ” “ I told promote . But ’ listen. ” “ I listened. ” “ You never listen , ” Colonel Korn persisted relish . “ That ’ reason ’ spot. ” “ All right , gee whiz . Stop rubbing , ? ” Colonel Cathcart burrowed fists deep inside pockets turned away slouch . “ Instead picking , ’ figure ’ going ? ” “ We ’ going send home , I ’ afraid. ” Colonel Korn chuckling triumphantly turned away Colonel Cathcart face Yossarian . “ Yossarian , war . We ’ going send home . You really ’ deserve , know , one reasons I ’ mind . Since ’ nothing else risk time , ’ decided return States . We ’ worked little deal to- “ “ What kind deal ? ” Yossarian demanded defiant mistrust . Colonel Korn tossed head back laughed . “ Oh , thoroughly despicable deal , make mistake . It ’ absolutely revolting . But ’ accept quickly enough. ” “ Don ’ sure. ” “ I ’ slightest doubt , even though stinks high heaven . Oh , way . You ’ told men ’ refused fly missions , ? ” “ No , sir , ” Yossarian answered promptly . Colonel Korn nodded approvingly . “ That ’ good . I like way lie . You ’ go far world ever acquire decent ambition. ” “ Doesn ’ know ’ war going ? ” Colonel Cathcart yelled suddenly , blew vigorous disbelief open end cigarette holder . “ I ’ quite sure , ” Colonel Korn replied acidly , “ since brought identical point attention moment ago. ” Colonel Korn frowned wearily Yossarian ’ benefit , eyes twinkling swarthily sly daring scorn . Gripping edge Colonel Cathcart ’ desk hands , lifted flaccid haunches far back corner sit short legs dangling freely . His shoes kicked lightly yellow oak wood , sludge-brown socks , garterless , collapsed sagging circles ankles surprisingly small white . “ You know , Yossarian , ” mused affably manner casual reflection seemed derisive sincere , “ I really admire bit . You ’ intelligent person great moral character taken courageous stand . I ’ intelligent person moral character , I ’ ideal position appreciate it. ” “ These critical times , ” Colonel Cathcart asserted petulantly far corner office , paying attention Colonel Korn . “ Very critical times indeed , ” Colonel Korn agreed placid nod . “ We ’ change command , ’ afford situation might put us bad light either General Scheisskopf General Peckem . Isn ’ mean , Colonel ? ” “ Hasn ’ got patriotism ? ” “ Won ’ fight country ? ” Colonel Korn demanded , emulating Colonel Cathcart ’ harsh , self-righteous tone . “ Won ’ give life Colonel Cathcart ? ” Yossarian tensed alert astonishment heard Colonel Korn ’ concluding words . “ What ’ ? ” exclaimed . “ What Colonel Cathcart got country ? You ’ same. ” “ How separate us ? ” Colonel Korn inquired ironical tranquillity . “ That ’ right , ” Colonel Cathcart cried emphatically . “ You ’ either us us . There ’ two ways it. ” “ I ’ afraid ’ got , ” added Colonel Korn . “ You ’ either us country . It ’ simple that. ” “ Oh , , Colonel . I ’ buy that. ” Colonel Korn unrufed . “ Neither I , frankly , everyone else . So are. ” “ You ’ disgrace uniform ! ” Colonel Cathcart declared blustering wrath , whirling confront Yossarian first time . “ I ’ like know ever got captain , anyway. ” “ You promoted , ” Colonel Korn reminded sweetly , stifling snicker . “ Don ’ remember ? ” “ Well , I never done it. ” “ I told , ” Colonel Korn said . “ But ’ listen me. ” “ Gee whiz , stop rubbing ? ” Colonel Cathcart cried . He furrowed brow glowered Colonel Korn eyes narrow suspicion , fists clenched hips . “ Say , whose side , anyway ? ” “ Your side , Colonel . What side could I ? ” “ Then stop picking , ? Get back , ? ” “ I ’ side , Colonel . I ’ loaded patriotism. ” “ Well , make sure ’ forget that. ” Colonel Cathcart turned away grudgingly another moment , incompletely reassured , began striding floor , hands kneading long cigarette holder . He jerked thumb toward Yossarian . “ Let ’ settle . I know I ’ like . I ’ like take outside shoot . That ’ I ’ like . That ’ General Dreedle would him. ” “ But General Dreedle ’ us , ” said Colonel Korn , “ ’ take outside shoot him. ” Now moment tension Colonel Cathcart passed , Colonel Korn relaxed resumed kicking softly Colonel Cathcart ’ desk . He returned Yossarian . “ So ’ going send home instead . It took bit thinking , finally worked horrible little plan sending home without causing much dissatisfaction among friends ’ leave behind . Doesn ’ make happy ? ” “ What kind plan ? I ’ sure I ’ going like it. ” “ I know ’ going like it. ” Colonel Korn laughed , locking hands contentedly top head . “ You ’ going loathe . It really odious certainly offend conscience . But ’ agree quickly enough . You ’ agree send home safe sound two weeks , choice . It ’ court-martial . Take leave it. ” Yossarian snorted . “ Stop bluffing , Colonel . You ’ court-martial desertion face enemy . It would make look bad probably ’ get conviction. ” “ But court-martial desertion duty , since went Rome without pass . And could make stick . If think minute , ’ see ’ leave us alternative . We ’ simply let keep walking around open insubordination without punishing . All men would stop flying missions , . No , word . We court-martial turn deal , even though would raise lot questions terrible black eye Colonel Cathcart. ” Colonel Cathcart winced words “ black eye ” , without apparent premeditation , hurled slender onyx-and-ivory cigarette holder viciously wooden surface desk . “ Jesus Christ ! ” shouted unexpectedly . “ I hate goddam cigarette holder ! ” The cigarette holder bounced desk wall , ricocheted across window sill floor came stop almost standing . Colonel Cathcart stared irascible scowl . “ I wonder ’ really good. ” “ It ’ feather cap General Peckem , black eye General Scheisskopf , ” Colonel Korn informed mischievous look innocence . “ Well , one I supposed please ? ” “ Both. ” “ How I please ? They hate . How I ever going get feather cap General Scheisskopf without getting black eye General Peckem ? ” “ March. ” “ Yeah , march . That ’ way please . March . March. ” Colonel Cathcart grimaced sullenly . “ Some generals ! They ’ disgrace uniforms . If people like two make general , I ’ see I miss. ” “ You ’ going go far. ” Colonel Korn assured flat lack conviction , turned back chuckling Yossarian , disdainful merriment increasing sight Yossarian ’ unyielding expression antagonism distrust . “ And crux situation . Colonel Cathcart wants general I want colonel , ’ send home. ” “ Why want general ? ” “ Why ? For reason I want colonel . What else got ? Everyone teaches us aspire higher things . A general higher colonel , colonel higher lieutenant colonel . So ’ aspiring . And know , Yossarian , ’ lucky thing . Your timing absolutely perfect , I suppose took factor account calculations. ” “ I ’ calculating , ” Yossarian retorted . “ Yes , I really enjoy way lie , ” Colonel Korn answered . “ Won ’ make proud commanding officer promoted general-to know served outfit averaged combat missions per person ? Don ’ want earn unit citations oak leaf clusters Air Medal ? Where ’ ‘ sprit de corps ? ’ Don ’ want contribute great record flying combat missions ? It ’ last chance answer yes. ” “ No. ” “ In case , us barrel- “ said Colonel Korn without rancor . “ He ought ashamed ! ” “ -and send home . Just little things us , and- “ “ What sort things ? ” Yossarian interrupted belligerent misgiving . “ Oh , tiny , insignificant things . Really , generous deal ’ making . We issue orders returning States-really , will-and return is… ” “ What ? What must I ? ” Colonel Korn laughed curtly . “ Like us. ” Yossarian blinked . “ Like ? ” “ Like us. ” “ Like ? ” “ That ’ right , ” said Colonel Korn , nodding , gratified immeasurably Yossarian ’ guileless surprise bewilderment . “ Like us . Join us . Be pal . Say nice things us back States . Become one boys . Now , ’ asking much , ? ” “ You want like ?

The important thing say people here. ” Colonel Korn leaned forward earnestly , longer smiling . “ We ’ want men group know ’ sending home result refusal fly missions . And ’ want General Peckem General Scheisskopf get wind friction us , either . That ’ ’ going become good pals. ” “ What I say men asked I refused fly missions ? ” “ Tell informed confidence returned States unwilling risk life another mission two .

Right ? ” “ Of course , ” said Colonel Korn . “ There ’ reason I risk life , ? ” “ Of course not. ” Yossarian arrived decision swift grin . “ It ’ deal ! ” announced jubilantly . “ Great , ” said Colonel Korn somewhat less cordiality Yossarian expected , slid Colonel Cathcart ’ desk stand floor . He tugged folds cloth pants undershorts free crotch gave Yossarian limp hand shake . “ Welcome aboard. ” “ Thanks , Colonel . I- “ “ Call Blackie , John . We ’ pals now. ” “ Sure , Blackie .

He home free : pulled ; act rebellion succeeded ; safe , nothing ashamed anyone . He started toward staircase jaunty exhilarated air . A private green fatigues saluted . Yossarian returned salute happily , staring private curiosity . He looked strangely familiar . When Yossarian returned salute , private green fatigues turned suddenly Nately ’ whore lunged murderously bone-handled kitchen knife caught side upraised arm . Yossarian sank floor shriek , shutting eyes overwhelming terror saw girl lift knife strike . He already unconscious Colonel Korn Colonel Cathcart dashed office saved life frightening away . 41 SNOWDEN “ Cut , ” said doctor . “ You cut , ” said another . “ No cuts , ” said Yossarian thick , unwieldy tongue . “ Now look ’ butting , ” complained one doctors . “ Another county heard .

A bland , phlegmatic smile hung brown face heavy-bearded cheeks , buffing facets bald head gently palms hands . He bent forward chuckling Yossarian awoke , assured friendliest tones deal made still Yossarian ’ die . Yossarian vomited , Colonel Korn shot feet first cough fled disgust , seemed indeed silver lining every cloud , Yossarian reflected , drifted back suffocating daze . A hand sharp fingers shook awake roughly . He turned opened eyes saw strange man mean face curled lip spiteful scowl bragged , “ We ’ got pal , buddy .

He cold , thought Snowden , never pal vaguely familiar kid badly wounded freezing death puddle harsh yellow sunlight splashing face side gunport Yossarian crawled rear section plane bomb bay Dobbs beseeched intercom help gunner , please help gunner . Yossarian ’ stomach turned eyes first beheld macabre scene ; absolutely revolted , paused fright moments descending , crouched hands knees narrow tunnel bomb bay beside sealed corrugated carton containing first-aid kit . Snowden lying back floor legs stretched , still burdened cumbersomely flak suit , flak helmet , parachute harness Mae West . Not far away floor lay small tail-gunner dead faint . The wound Yossarian saw outside Snowden ’ thigh , large deep football , seemed . It impossible tell shreds saturated coveralls ended ragged flesh began . There morphine first-aid kit , protection Snowden pain numbing shock gaping wound . The twelve syrettes morphine stolen case replaced cleanly lettered note said : “ What ’ good M amp ; M Enterprises good country . Milo Minderbinder. ” Yossarian swore Milo held two aspirins ashen lips unable receive . But first hastily drew tourniquet around Snowden ’ thigh could think else first tumultuous moments senses turmoil , knew must act competently feared might go pieces completely . Snowden watched steadily , saying nothing . No artery spurting , Yossarian pretended absorb entirely fashioning tourniquet , applying tourniquet something know . He worked simulated skill composure , feeling Snowden ’ lack-luster gaze resting upon . He recovered possession tourniquet finished loosened immediately lessen danger gangrene . His mind clear , knew proceed . He rummaged first-aid kit scissors . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden said softly . “ I ’ cold. ” “ You ’ going right , kid , ” Yossarian reassured grin . “ You ’ going right. ” “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden said frail , childlike voice . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian said , know else say . “ There , there. ” “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , .

He cut heavy gabardine cloth way around thigh straight line . The tiny tailgunner woke Yossarian cutting scissors , saw , fainted . Snowden rolled head side neck order stare Yossarian directly . A dim , sunken light glowed weak listless eyes . Yossarian , puzzled , tried look . He began cutting downward coveralls along inside seam . The yawning wound-was tube slimy bone saw running deep inside gory scarlet flow behind twitching , startling fibers weird muscle ? – dripping blood several trickles , like snow melting eaves , viscous red , already thickening dropped . Yossarian kept cutting coveralls bottom peeled open severed leg garment . It fell floor plop , exposing hem khaki undershorts soaking blotches blood one side though thirst . Yossarian stunned waxen ghastly Snowden ’ bare leg looked , loathsome , lifeless esoteric downy , fine , curled blond hairs odd white shin calf . The wound , saw , nearly large football , long wide hand raw deep see clearly . The raw muscles inside twitched like live hamburger meat . A long sigh relief escaped slowly Yossarian ’ mouth saw Snowden danger dying . The blood already coagulating inside wound , simply matter bandaging keeping calm plane landed . He removed packets sulfanilamide first-aid kit . Snowden quivered Yossarian pressed gently turn slightly side . “ Did I hurt ? ” “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian said . “ There , there. ” “ I ’ cold .

Yossarian removed Snowden ’ flak helmet lowered head floor . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden moaned half-closed eyes . “ I ’ cold. ” The edges mouth turning blue . Yossarian petrified . He wondered whether pull rip cord Snowden ’ parachute cover nylon folds . It warm plane . Glancing unexpectedly , Snowden gave wan , co-operative smile shifted position hips bit Yossarian could begin salting wound sulfanilamide . Yossarian worked renewed confidence optimism . The plane bounced hard inside air pocket , remembered start left parachute front nose . There nothing done . He poured envelope envelope white crystalline powder bloody oval wound nothing red could seen drew deep , apprehensive breath , steeling gritted teeth touched bare hand dangling shreds drying flesh tuck inside wound .

In little ’ back ground Doc Daneeka take care you. ” But Snowden kept shaking head pointed last , barest movement chin , toward armpit . Yossarian bent forward peer saw strangely colored stain seeping coveralls armhole Snowden ’ flak suit . Yossarian felt heart stop , pound violently found difficult breathe . Snowden wounded inside flak suit . Yossarian ripped open snaps Snowden ’ flak suit heard scream wildly Snowden ’ insides slithered floor soggy pile kept dripping . A chunk flak three inches big shot side underneath arm blasted way , drawing whole mottled quarts Snowden along gigantic hole ribs made blasted . Yossarian screamed second time squeezed hands eyes . His teeth chattering horror . He forced look . Here God ’ plenty , right , thought bitterly stared-liver , lungs , kidneys , ribs , stomach bits stewed tomatoes Snowden eaten day lunch . Yossarian hated stewed tomatoes turned away dizzily began vomit , clutching burning throat . The tail gunner woke Yossarian vomiting , saw , fainted .

He wondered world begin save . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian mumbled mechanically voice low heard . “ There , there. ” Yossarian cold , , shivering uncontrollably .

Everything working fine. ” “ No ’ t. ” “ Oh , yes , indeed , ” Major Danby insisted benevolently . “ In fact , everything much better . It really stroke luck almost murdered girl . Now deal go perfectly. ” “ I ’ making deals Colonel Korn. ” Major Danby ’ effervescent optimism vanished instantly , broke bubbling sweat . “ But deal , ’ ? ” asked anguished puzzlement . “ Don ’ agreement ? ” “ I ’ breaking agreement. ” “ But shook hands , ’ ? You gave word gentleman. ” “ I ’ breaking word. ” “ Oh , dear , ” sighed Major Danby , began dabbing ineffectually careworn brow folded white handkerchief . “ But , Yossarian ? It ’ good deal ’ offering you. ” “ It ’ lousy deal , Danby . It ’ odious deal. ” “ Oh , dear , ” Major Danby fretted , running bare hand dark , wiry hair , already soaked perspiration tops thick , close-cropped waves . “ Oh dear. ” “ Danby , ’ think ’ odious ? ” Major Danby pondered moment . “ Yes , I suppose odious , ” conceded reluctance . His globular , exophthalmic eyes quite distraught . “ But make deal ’ like ? ” “ I moment weakness , ” Yossarian wisecracked glum irony . “ I trying save life. ” “ Don ’ want save life ? ” “ That ’ I ’ let make fly missions. ” “ Then let send home ’ danger. ” “ Let send home I flew fifty missions , ” Yossarian said , “ I stabbed girl , I ’ turned stubborn son bitch. ” Major Danby shook head emphatically sincere bespectacled vexation . “ They ’ send nearly every man home . Most men fifty missions . Colonel Cathcart ’ possibly requisition many inexperienced replacement crews one time without causing investigation . He ’ caught trap. ” “ That ’ problem. ” “ No , , , Yossarian , ” Major Danby disagreed solicitously . “ It ’ problem . Because ’ go deal , ’ going institute court-martial proceedings soon sign hospital. ” Yossarian thumbed nose Major Danby laughed smug elation . “ The hell ! Don ’ lie , Danby . They ’ even try. ” “ But ’ ? ” inquired Major Danby , blinking astonishment . “ Because I ’ really got barrel . There ’ official report says I stabbed Nazi assassin trying kill . They ’ certainly look silly trying court-martial that. ” “ But , Yossarian ! ” Major Danby exclaimed . “ There ’ another official report says stabbed innocent girl course extensive black-market operations involving acts sabotage sale military secrets enemy. ” Yossarian taken back severely surprise disappointment . “ Another official report ? ” “ Yossarian , prepare many official reports want choose whichever ones need given occasion .

It ’ best everyone way. ” “ It ’ best Cathcart , Korn , everyone. ” “ For everyone , ” Major Danby insisted . “ It solve whole problem. ” “ Is best men group keep flying missions ? ” Major Danby flinched turned face away uncomfortably second . “ Yossarian , ” replied , “ help nobody force Colonel Cathcart court-martial prove guilty crimes ’ charged . You go prison long time , whole life ruined. ” Yossarian listened growing feeling concern . “ What crimes charge ? ” “ Incompetence Ferrara , insubordination , refusal engage enemy combat ordered , desertion. ” Yossarian sucked cheeks soberly . “ They could charge , could ? They gave medal Ferrara . How could charge incompetence ? ” “ Aarfy swear McWatt lied official report. ” “ I ’ bet bastard would ! ” “ They also find guilty , ” Major Danby recited , “ rape , extensive black-market operations , acts sabotage sale military secrets enemy. ” “ How prove ? I never single one things. ” “ But witnesses swear . They get witnesses need simply persuading destroying good country . And way , would good country. ” “ In way ? ” Yossarian demanded , rising slowly one elbow bridling hostility . Major Danby drew back bit began mopping forehead . “ Well , Yossarian , ” began apologetic stammer , “ would help war effort bring Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn disrepute . Let ’ face , Yossarian-in spite everything , group good record . If court-martialed found innocent , men would probably refuse fly missions , . Colonel Cathcart would disgrace , military efficiency unit might destroyed . So way would good country found guilty put prison , even though innocent. ” “ What sweet way putting things ! ” Yossarian snapped caustic resentment . Major Danby turned red squirmed squinted uneasily . “ Please ’ blame , ” pleaded look anxious integrity . “ You know ’ fault . All I ’ trying look things objectively arrive solution difficult situation. ” “ I ’ create situation. ” “ But resolve . And else ? You ’ want fly missions. ” “ I run away. ” “ Run away ? ” “ Desert .

And I could hide there. ” “ And live danger every minute life would find ? No , , , , Yossarian . That would disastrous ignoble thing . Running away problems never solved . Please believe . I trying help you. ” “ That ’ kind detective said decided jab thumb wound , ” Yossarian retorted sarcastically . “ I detective , ” Major Danby replied indignation , cheeks flushing . “ I ’ university professor highly developed sense right wrong , I ’ try deceive . I ’ lie anyone. ” “ What would one men group asked conversation ? ” “ I would lie him. ” Yossarian laughed mockingly , Major Danby , despite blushing discomfort , leaned back relief , though welcoming respite Yossarian ’ changing mood promised . Yossarian gazed mixture reserved pity contempt . He sat bed back resting headboard , lit cigarette , smiled slightly wry amusement , stared whimsical sympathy vivid , pop-eyed horror implanted permanently Major Danby ’ face day mission Avignon , General Dreedle ordered taken outside shot . The startled wrinkles would always remain , like deep black scars , Yossarian felt sorry gentle , moral , middle-aged idealist , felt sorry many people whose shortcomings large whose troubles light . With deliberate amiability said , “ Danby , work along people like Cathcart Korn ? Doesn ’ turn stomach ? ” Major Danby seemed surprised Yossarian ’ question . “ I help country , ” replied , though answer obvious . “ Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn superiors , obeying orders contribution I make war effort . I work along ’ duty . And also , ” added much lower voice , dropping eyes , “ I aggressive person. ” “ Your country ’ need help , ” Yossarian reasoned antagonism . “ So ’ helping them. ” “ I try think , ” Major Danby admitted frankly . “ But I try concentrate big result forget succeeding , . I try pretend significant. ” “ That ’ trouble , know , ” Yossarian mused sympathetically , folding arms . “ Between every ideal I always find Scheisskopfs , Peckems , Korns Cathcarts . And sort changes ideal. ” “ You must try think , ” Major Danby advised affirmatively . “ And must never let change values . Ideals good , people sometimes good . You must try look big picture. ” Yossarian rejected advice skeptical shake head . “ When I look , I see people cashing . I ’ see heaven saints angels . I see people cashing every decent impulse every human tragedy. ” “ But must try think , , ” Major Danby insisted . “ And must try let upset you. ” “ Oh , ’ really upset . What upset , though , think I ’ sucker . They think ’ smart , rest us dumb . And , know , Danby , thought occurs right , first time , maybe ’ right. ” “ But must try think , ” argued Major Danby . “ You must think welfare country dignity man. ” “ Yeah , ” said Yossarian . “ I mean , Yossarian . This World War One . You must never forget ’ war aggressors would let either one us live won. ” “ I know , ” Yossarian replied tersely , sudden surge scowling annoyance . “ Christ , Danby , I earned medal I got , matter reasons giving . I ’ flown seventy goddam combat missions . Don ’ talk fighting save country . I ’ fighting along save country . Now I ’ going fight little save . The country ’ danger , I am. ” “ The war ’ yet . The Germans driving toward Antwerp. ” “ The Germans beaten months . And Japan beaten months . If I give life , ’ country . It would Cathcart Korn . So I ’ turning bombsight duration . From I ’ thinking me. ” Major Danby replied indulgently superior smile , “ But , Yossarian , suppose everyone felt way. ” “ Then I ’ certainly damned fool feel way , ’ I ? ” Yossarian sat straighter quizzical expression . “ You know , I queer feeling I ’ exact conversation someone . It ’ like chaplain ’ sensation experienced everything twice. ” “ The chaplain wants let send home , ” Major Danby remarked . “ The chaplain jump lake. ” “ Oh , dear. ” Major Danby sighed , shaking head regretful disappointment . “ He ’ afraid might influenced you. ” “ He ’ influence . You know I might ? I might stay right hospital bed vegetate . I could vegetate comfortably right let people make decisions. ” “ You must make decisions , ” Major Danby disagreed . “ A person ’ live like vegetable. ” “ Why ? ” A distant warm look entered Major Danby ’ eyes . “ It must nice live like vegetable , ” conceded wistfully . “ It ’ lousy , ” answered Yossarian . “ No , must pleasant free doubt pressure , ” insisted Major Danby . “ I think I ’ like live like vegetable make important decisions. ” “ What kind vegetable , Danby ? ” “ A cucumber carrot. ” “ What kind cucumber ? A good one bad one ? ” “ Oh , good one , course. ” “ They ’ cut prime slice salad. ” Major Danby ’ face fell . “ A poor one , then. ” “ They ’ let rot use fertilizer help good ones grow. ” “ I guess I ’ want live like vegetable , , ” said Major Danby smile sad resignation . “ Danby , must I really let send home ? ” Yossarian inquired seriously . Major Danby shrugged . “ It ’ way save yourself. ” “ It ’ way lose , Danby . You ought know that. ” “ You could lots things want. ” “ I ’ want lots things I want , ” Yossarian replied , beat fist mattress outburst rage frustration . “ Goddammit , Danby ! I ’ got friends killed war . I ’ make deal . Getting stabbed bitch best thing ever happened me. ” “ Would rather go jail ? ” “ Would let send home ? ” “ Of course I would ! ” Major Danby declared conviction . “ Certainly I would , ” added moments later , less positive manner . “ Yes , I suppose I would let send home I place , ” decided uncomfortably , lapsing troubled contemplation . Then threw face sideways disgustedly gesture violent distress blurted , “ Oh , yes , course I ’ let send home ! But I ’ terrible coward I ’ really place. ” “ But suppose ’ coward ? ” Yossarian demanded , studying closely . “ Suppose courage defy somebody ? ” “ Then I ’ let send home , ” Major Danby vowed emphatically vigorous joy enthusiasm . “ But I certainly ’ let court-martial me. ” “ Would fly missions ? ” “ No , course . That would total capitulation . And I might killed. ” “ Then ’ run away ? ” Major Danby started retort proud spirit came abrupt stop , half-opened jaw swinging closed dumbly . He pursed lips tired pout . “ I guess ’ hope , , would ? ” His forehead protuberant white eyeballs soon glistening nervously . He crossed limp wrists lap hardly seemed breathing sat gaze drooping toward floor acquiescent defeat . Dark , steep shadows slanted window . Yossarian watched solemnly , neither two men stirred rattling noise speeding vehicle skidding stop outside sound racing footsteps pounding toward building haste . “ Yes , ’ hope , ” Yossarian remembered sluggish flow inspiration . “ Milo might help . He ’ bigger Colonel Cathcart , owes favors. ” Major Danby shook head answered tonelessly . “ Milo Colonel Cathcart pals . He made Colonel Cathcart vice-president promised important job war. ” “ Then ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen help us , ” Yossarian exclaimed . “ He hates , infuriate him. ” Major Danby shook head bleakly . “ Milo ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen merged last week . They ’ partners M amp ; M Enterprises. ” “ Then hope us , ? ” “ No hope. ” “ No hope , ? ” “ No , hope , ” Major Danby conceded . He looked half-formed notion . “ Wouldn ’ nice could disappear us way disappeared others relieve us crushing burdens ? ” Yossarian said .

Then came September paperback edition , finally , expansion popular appeal seemed take publishers , Dell , surprise , despite elaborate promotion distribution strategies . It seemed people could fully bring believe sales figures would never catch . Paperback publishers print hundreds thousands . For , initial release 300,000 copies , went back press five times September end year , twice October December , end 1963 , eleven printings . In England , auspices enterprising young editor , Tom Maschler , way start . Bestseller lists new rudimentary , Catch-22 quickly head . For history Catch-22 begins back 1953 , I started writing . In 1953 , I employed copywriter small advertising agency New York , two years instructor English composition Pennsylvania State University , college . Early , anxious need approving opinion , I sent opening chapter literary agents I managed obtain publishing short stories magazines , Esquire The Atlantic . The agents impressed , young assistant , Ms. Candida Donadio , , secured permission submit chapter publications regularly published excerpts “ novels progress ” . In 1955 chapter appeared paperback quarterly , New World Writing ( anthology also contained , pseudonym , extract another novel progress-Jack Kerouac ’ On Road ) . There came complimentary letters interest editors established book publishers , I encouraged continue work I saw realistically going take good many years longer I first guessed . In 1957 , I 270 pages typescript , I employed Time magazine , writing advertising-sales presentations day furtively putting thoughts paper work novel home evening . And Candida Donadio establishing pre-eminent agent right , list American authors clients impressive . We agreed made sense submit partial manuscript publishers , mainly obtain practical idea potential publication novel thought much . She drawn toward new young editor knew Simon amp ; Schuster , one thought might prove receptive innovation . His name Robert Gottlieb , right . While Gottlieb busied pages , I , four-week summer vacation bountiful Time magazine , began rewriting . Gottlieb I met lunch , mainly gauge temperament ascertain amenable I would author work . After I listened allude tact certain broad suggestions thought eventually might compelled make , I handed new pages boastful response I already taken care nearly . He surprised concern I might take exception working someone young-he twenty-six , I think , I thirty-four . I greatly surprised learn later closest colleague Simon amp ; Schuster , Nina Bourne , intimidated first air suspicion I projected I know I even possessed . I suspicious since , I doubt much Gottlieb , went become head Alfred A. Knopf editor The New Yorker magazine , ever intimidated anybody . And I still remember agreeably ask outline seek even hint one-third novel ’ seen going go . The contract I received called advance fifteen hundred dollars , half signing , I need , remainder completion acceptance . Probably , I first novelist , first published ; authors completed manuscripts came three years I needed finish mine . Probably , I Candida ’ earliest client . Both delighted I eventual success Catch-22 , three us reveling recollections experience ever since . On February 28 , 1962 , journalist Richard Starnes published column unrestrained praise newspaper , The New York World-Telegram , opened words : “ Yossarian , I think , live long time. ” His tribute unexpected , Mr. Starnes newspaperman hard-boiled mode whose customary beat local politics , World-Telegram widely regarded generally conservative . To day I grateful Mr. Starnes unqualified unsolicited approval bless accuracy prediction . Yossarian indeed lived long time . Mr. Starnes passed . Many people mentioned first advertisement died , rest us way . But Yossarian alive novel ends . Because motion picture , even close readers novel final , lasting image sea , paddling toward freedom yellow inflated lifeboat . In book ’ get far ; captured ’ dead . At end successor volume I ’ completed , Closing Time ( fleeing cartoon figure book jacket American edition , wearing businessman ’ chapeau moving cane ) , still alive , forty years older definitely still . “ Everyone got go , ” physician friend novel reminds emphasis . “ Everyone ! ” But I ever write another sequel , would still around end . Sooner later , I must concede , Yossarian , seventy , pass away . But ’ hand . Joseph Heller , 1994 East Hampton , New YorkJoseph Heller Catch-22 The island Pianosa lies Mediterranean Sea eight miles south Elba . It small obviously could accommodate actions described . Like setting novel , characters , , fictitious . TO MY MOTHER AND TO SHIRLEY , AND MY CHILDREN , ERICA AND TED 1 THE TEXAN It love first sight . The first time Yossarian saw chaplain fell madly love . Yossarian hospital pain liver fell short jaundice . The doctors puzzled fact ’ quite jaundice . If became jaundice could treat . If ’ become jaundice went away could discharge . But short jaundice time confused . Each morning came around , three brisk serious men efficient mouths inefficient eyes , accompanied brisk serious Nurse Duckett , one ward nurses ’ like Yossarian . They read chart foot bed asked impatiently pain . They seemed irritated told exactly . “ Still movement ? ” full colonel demanded . The doctors exchanged look shook head . “ Give another pill. ” Nurse Duckett made note give Yossarian another pill , four moved along next bed . None nurses liked Yossarian . Actually , pain liver gone away , Yossarian ’ say anything doctors never suspected . They suspected moving bowels telling anyone . Yossarian everything wanted hospital . The food ’ bad , meals brought bed . There extra rations fresh meat , hot part afternoon others served chilled fruit juice chilled chocolate milk . Apart doctors nurses , one ever disturbed . For little morning censor letters , free spend rest day lying around idly clear conscience . He comfortable hospital , easy stay always ran temperature 101 . He even comfortable Dunbar , keep falling face order get meals brought bed . After made mind spend rest war hospital , Yossarian wrote letters everyone knew saying hospital never mentioning . One day better idea . To everyone knew wrote going dangerous mission . “ They asked volunteers . It ’ dangerous , someone . I ’ write instant I get back. ” And written anyone since . All officer patients ward forced censor letters written enlisted-men patients , kept residence wards . It monotonous job , Yossarian disappointed learn lives enlisted men slightly interesting lives officers . After first day curiosity . To break monotony invented games . Death modifiers , declared one day , every letter passed hands went every adverb every adjective . The next day made war articles . He reached much higher plane creativity following day blacked everything letters , . That erected dynamic intralinear tensions , felt , every case left message far universal . Soon proscribing parts salutations signatures leaving text untouched . One time blacked salutation “ Dear Mary ” letter , bottom wrote , “ I yearn tragically . R. O. Shipman , Chaplain , U.S. Army. ” R. O. Shipman group chaplain ’ name . When exhausted possibilities letters , began attacking names addresses envelopes , obliterating whole homes streets , annihilating entire metropolises careless flicks wrist though God . Catch-22 required censored letter bear censoring officer ’ name . Most letters ’ read . On ’ read wrote name . On read wrote , “ Washington Irving. ” When grew monotonous wrote , “ Irving Washington. ” Censoring envelopes serious repercussions , produced ripple anxiety ethereal military echelon floated C.I.D . man back ward posing patient . They knew C.I.D . man kept inquiring officer named Irving Washington first day ’ censor letters . He found monotonous . It good ward time , one best Dunbar ever enjoyed . With time twenty-four-year-old fighter-pilot captain sparse golden mustache shot Adriatic Sea midwinter even caught cold . Now summer upon , captain shot , said grippe . In bed Yossarian ’ right , still lying amorously belly , startled captain malaria blood mosquito bite ass . Across aisle Yossarian Dunbar , next Dunbar artillery captain Yossarian stopped playing chess . The captain good chess player , games always interesting . Yossarian stopped playing chess games interesting foolish . Then educated Texan Texas looked like someone Technicolor felt , patriotically , people means-decent folk-should given votes drifters , whores , criminals , degenerates , atheists indecent folk-people without means . Yossarian unspringing rhythms letters day brought Texan . It another quiet , hot , untroubled day . The heat pressed heavily roof , stifling sound . Dunbar lying motionless back eyes staring ceiling like doll ’ . He working hard increasing life span . He cultivating boredom . Dunbar working hard increasing life span Yossarian thought dead . They put Texan bed middle ward , ’ long donated views . Dunbar sat like shot . “ That ’ , ” cried excitedly . “ There something missing-all time I knew something missing-and I know is. ” He banged fist palm . “ No patriotism , ” declared . “ You ’ right , ” Yossarian shouted back . “ You ’ right , ’ right , ’ right . The hot dog , Brooklyn Dodgers . Mom ’ apple pie . That ’ everyone ’ fighting . But ’ fighting decent folk ? Who ’ fighting votes decent folk ? There ’ patriotism , ’ . And matriotism , either. ” The warrant officer Yossarian ’ left unimpressed . “ Who gives shit ? ” asked tiredly , turned side go sleep . The Texan turned good-natured , generous likable . In three days one could stand . He sent shudders annoyance scampering ticklish spines , everybody fled him-everybody soldier white , choice . The soldier white encased head toe plaster gauze . He two useless legs two useless arms . He smuggled ward night , men idea among awoke morning saw two strange legs hoisted hips , two strange arms anchored perpendicularly , four limbs pinioned strangely air lead weights suspended darkly never moved . Sewn bandages insides elbows zippered lips fed clear fluid clear jar . A silent zinc pipe rose cement groin coupled slim rubber hose carried waste kidneys dripped efficiently clear , stoppered jar floor . When jar floor full , jar feeding elbow empty , two simply switched quickly stuff could drip back . All ever really saw soldier white frayed black hole mouth . The soldier white filed next Texan , Texan sat sideways bed talked throughout morning , afternoon evening pleasant , sympathetic drawl . The Texan never minded got reply . Temperatures taken twice day ward . Early morning late afternoon Nurse Cramer entered jar full thermometers worked way one side ward , distributing thermometer patient . She managed soldier white inserting thermometer hole mouth leaving balanced lower rim . When returned man first bed , took thermometer recorded temperature , moved next bed continued around ward . One afternoon completed first circuit ward came second time soldier white , read thermometer discovered dead . “ Murderer , ” Dunbar said quietly . The Texan looked uncertain grin . “ Killer , ” Yossarian said . What fellas talkin ” ? ” Texan asked nervously . “ You murdered , ” said Dunbar . “ You killed , ” said Yossarian . The Texan shrank back . “ You fellas crazy . I ’ even touch him. ” “ You murdered , ” said Dunbar . “ I heard kill , ” said Yossarian . “ You killed nigger , ” Dunbar said . “ You fellas crazy , ” Texan cried . “ They ’ allow niggers . They got special place niggers. ” “ The sergeant smuggled , ” Dunbar said . “ The Communist sergeant , ” said Yossarian . “ And knew it. ” The warrant officer Yossarian ’ left unimpressed entire incident soldier white . The warrant officer unimpressed everything never spoke unless show irritation . The day Yossarian met chaplain , stove exploded mess hall set fire one side kitchen . An intense heat flashed area . Even Yossarian ’ ward , almost three hundred feet away , could hear roar blaze sharp cracks flaming timber . Smoke sped past orange-tinted windows . In fifteen minutes crash trucks airfield arrived fight fire . For frantic half hour touch go . Then firemen began get upper hand . Suddenly monotonous old drone bombers returning mission , firemen roll hoses speed back field case one planes crashed caught fire . The planes landed safely . As soon last one , firemen wheeled trucks around raced back hill resume fight fire hospital . When got , blaze . It died accord , expired completely without even ember watered , nothing disappointed firemen drink tepid coffee hang around trying screw nurses . The chaplain arrived day fire . Yossarian busy expurgating romance words letters chaplain sat chair beds asked feeling . He placed bit one side , captain ’ bars tab shirt collar insignia Yossarian could see . Yossarian idea took granted either another doctor another madman . “ Oh , pretty good , ” answered . “ I ’ got slight pain liver I ’ regular fellows , I guess , I must admit I feel pretty good. ” “ That ’ good , ” said chaplain . “ Yes , ” Yossarian said . “ Yes , good. ” “ I meant come around sooner , ” chaplain said , “ I really ’ well. ” “ That ’ bad , ” Yossarian said . “ Just head cold , ” chaplain added quickly . “ I ’ got fever hundred one , ” Yossarian added quickly . “ That ’ bad , ” said chaplain . “ Yes , ” Yossarian agreed . “ Yes , bad. ” The chaplain fidgeted . “ Is anything I ? ” asked . “ No , no. ” Yossarian sighed . “ The doctors ’ humanly possible , I suppose. ” “ No , no. ” The chaplain colored faintly . “ I ’ mean anything like . I meant cigarettes… books… or… toys. ” “ No , , ” Yossarian said . “ Thank . I everything I need , I suppose-everything good health. ” “ That ’ bad. ” “ Yes , ” Yossarian said . “ Yes , bad. ” The chaplain stirred . He looked side side times , gazed ceiling , floor . He drew deep breath . “ Lieutenant Nately sends regards , ” said . Yossarian sorry hear mutual friend . It seemed basis conversation . “ You know Lieutenant Nately ? ” asked regretfully . “ Yes , I know Lieutenant Nately quite well. ” “ He ’ bit loony , ’ ? ” The chaplain ’ smile embarrassed . “ I ’ afraid I ’ say . I ’ think I know well. ” “ You take word , ” Yossarian said . “ He ’ goofy come. ” The chaplain weighed next silence heavily shattered abrupt question . “ You Captain Yossarian , ’ ? ” “ Nately bad start . He came good family. ” “ Please excuse , ” chaplain persisted timorously . “ I may committing grave error . Are Captain Yossarian ? ” “ Yes , ” Captain Yossarian confessed . “ I Captain Yossarian. ” “ Of 256th Squadron ? ” “ Of fighting 256th Squadron , ” Yossarian replied . “ I ’ know Captain Yossarians . As far I know , I ’ Captain Yossarian I know , ’ far I know. ” “ I see , ” chaplain said unhappily . “ That ’ two fighting eighth power , ” Yossarian pointed , “ ’ thinking writing symbolic poem squadron. ” “ No , ” mumbled chaplain . “ I ’ thinking writing symbolic poem squadron. ” Yossarian straightened sharply spied tiny silver cross side chaplain ’ collar . He thoroughly astonished , never really talked chaplain . “ You ’ chaplain , ” exclaimed ecstatically . “ I ’ know chaplain. ” “ Why , yes , ” chaplain answered . “ Didn ’ know I chaplain ? ” “ Why , . I ’ know chaplain. ” Yossarian stared big , fascinated grin . “ I ’ never really seen chaplain before. ” The chaplain flushed gazed hands . He slight man thirty-two tan hair brown diffident eyes . His face narrow rather pale . An innocent nest ancient pimple pricks lay basin cheek . Yossarian wanted help . “ Can I anything help ? ” chaplain asked . Yossarian shook head , still grinning . “ No , I ’ sorry . I everything I need I ’ quite comfortable . In fact , I ’ even sick. ” “ That ’ good. ” As soon chaplain said words , sorry shoved knuckles mouth giggle alarm , Yossarian remained silent disappointed . “ There men group I must visit , ” apologized finally . “ I ’ come see , probably tomorrow. ” “ Please , ” Yossarian said . “ I ’ come want , ” chaplain said , lowering head shyly . “ I ’ noticed I make many men uncomfortable. ” Yossarian glowed affection . “ I want , ” said . “ You ’ make uncomfortable. ” The chaplain beamed gratefully peered slip paper concealing hand . He counted along beds ward , moving lips , centered attention dubiously Dunbar . “ May I inquire , ” whispered softly , “ Lieutenant Dunbar ? ” “ Yes , ” Yossarian answered loudly , “ Lieutenant Dunbar. ” “ Thank , ” chaplain whispered . “ Thank much . I must visit . I must visit every member group hospital. ” “ Even wards ? ” Yossarian asked . “ Even wards. ” “ Be careful wards , Father , ” Yossarian warned . “ That ’ keep mental cases . They ’ filled lunatics. ” “ It ’ necessary call Father , ” chaplain explained . “ I ’ Anabaptist. ” “ I ’ dead serious wards , ” Yossarian continued grimly . “ M.P.s ’ protect , ’ craziest . I ’ go , I ’ scared stiff : Insanity contagious . This sane ward whole hospital . Everybody crazy us . This probably sane ward whole world , matter. ” The chaplain rose quickly edged away Yossarian ’ bed , nodded conciliating smile promised conduct appropriate caution . “ And I must visit Lieutenant Dunbar , ” said . Still lingered , remorsefully . “ How Lieutenant Dunbar ? ” asked last . “ As good go , ” Yossarian assured . “ A true prince . One finest , least dedicated men whole world. ” “ I ’ mean , ” chaplain answered , whispering . “ Is sick ? ” “ No , ’ sick . In fact , ’ sick all. ” “ That ’ good. ” The chaplain sighed relief . “ Yes , ” Yossarian said . “ Yes , good. ” “ A chaplain , ” Dunbar said chaplain visited gone . “ Did see ? A chaplain. ” “ Wasn ’ sweet ? ” said Yossarian . “ Maybe give three votes. ” “ Who ’ ? ” Dunbar demanded suspiciously . In bed small private section end ward , always working ceaselessly behind green plyboard partition , solemn middle-aged colonel visited every day gentle , sweet-faced woman curly ash-blond hair nurse Wac Red Cross girl nevertheless appeared faithfully hospital Pianosa afternoon wearing pretty pastel summer dresses smart white leather pumps heels half high base nylon seams inevitably straight . The colonel Communications , kept busy day night transmitting glutinous messages interior square pads gauze sealed meticulously delivered covered white pail stood night table beside bed .

When rose walk , bent forward even , making deep cavity body , placed feet carefully , moving ahead inches knees . There violet pools eyes . The woman spoke softly , softer colonel coughed , none men ward ever heard voice . In less ten days Texan cleared ward . The artillery captain broke first , exodus started . Dunbar , Yossarian fighter captain bolted morning . Dunbar stopped dizzy spells , fighter captain blew nose . Yossarian told doctors pain liver gone away . It easy . Even warrant officer fled . In less ten days , Texan drove everybody ward back duty-everybody C.I.D . man , caught cold fighter captain come pneumonia . 2 CLEVINGER In way C.I.D . man pretty lucky , outside hospital war still going . Men went mad rewarded medals . All world , boys every side bomb line laying lives told country , one seemed mind , least boys laying young lives . There end sight . The end sight Yossarian ’ , might remained hospital doomsday patriotic Texan infundibuliform jowls lumpy , rumpleheaded , indestructible smile cracked forever across front face like brim black ten-gallon hat . The Texan wanted everybody ward happy Yossarian Dunbar . He really sick . But Yossarian ’ happy , even though Texan ’ want , outside hospital still nothing funny going . The thing going war , one seemed notice Yossarian Dunbar . And Yossarian tried remind people , drew away thought crazy . Even Clevinger , known better ’ , told crazy last time seen , Yossarian fled hospital . Clevinger stared apoplectic rage indignation , clawing table hands , shouted , “ You ’ crazy ! ” “ Clevinger , want people ? ” Dunbar replied wearily noises officers ’ club . “ I ’ joking , ” Clevinger persisted . “ They ’ trying kill , ” Yossarian told calmly . “ No one ’ trying kill , ” Clevinger cried . “ Then shooting ? ” Yossarian asked . “ They ’ shooting everyone , ” Clevinger answered . “ They ’ trying kill everyone. ” “ And difference make ? ” Clevinger already way , half chair emotion , eyes moist lips quivering pale . As always occurred quarreled principles believed passionately , would end gasping furiously air blinking back bitter tears conviction . There many principles Clevinger believed passionately . He crazy . “ Who ’ ? ” wanted know . “ Who , specifically , think trying murder ? ” “ Every one , ” Yossarian told . “ Every one ? ” “ Every one think ? ” “ I ’ idea. ” “ Then know ’ ? ” “ Because… ” Clevinger sputtered , turned speechless frustration . Clevinger really thought right , Yossarian proof , strangers ’ know shot cannons every time flew air drop bombs , ’ funny . And ’ funny , lots things ’ even funnier . There nothing funny living like bum tent Pianosa fat mountains behind placid blue sea front could gulp person cramp twinkling eye ship back shore three days later , charges paid , bloated , blue putrescent , water draining cold nostrils . The tent lived stood right smack wall shallow , dull-colored forest separating squadron Dunbar ’ . Immediately alongside abandoned railroad ditch carried pipe carried aviation gasoline fuel trucks airfield . Thanks Orr , roommate , luxurious tent squadron . Each time Yossarian returned one holidays hospital rest leaves Rome , surprised new comfort Orr installed absence-running water , wood-burning fireplace , cement floor . Yossarian chosen site , Orr raised tent together . Orr , grinning pygmy pilot ’ wings thick , wavy brown hair parted middle , furnished knowledge , Yossarian , taller , stronger , broader faster , work . Just two lived , although tent big enough six . When summer came , Orr rolled side flaps allow breeze never blew flush away air baking inside . Immediately next door Yossarian Havermeyer , liked peanut brittle lived two-man tent shot tiny field mice every night huge bullets the.45 stolen dead man Yossarian ’ tent . On side Havermeyer stood tent McWatt longer shared Clevinger , still returned Yossarian came hospital . McWatt shared tent Nately , away Rome courting sleepy whore fallen deeply love bored work bored . McWatt crazy . He pilot flew plane low dared Yossarian ’ tent often could , see much could frighten , loved go buzzing wild , close roar wooden raft floating empty oil drums past sand bar immaculate white beach men went swimming naked . Sharing tent man crazy ’ easy , Nately ’ care . He crazy , , gone every free day work officers ’ club Yossarian helped build . Actually , many officers ’ clubs Yossarian helped build , proudest one Pianosa . It sturdy complex monument powers determination . Yossarian never went help finished ; went often , pleased large , fine , rambling , shingled building . It truly splendid structure , Yossarian throbbed mighty sense accomplishment time gazed reflected none work gone . There four seated together table officers ’ club last time Clevinger called crazy . They seated back near crap table Appleby always managed win . Appleby good shooting crap playing ping-pong , good playing ping-pong everything else . Everything Appleby , well . Appleby fair-haired boy Iowa believed God , Motherhood American Way Life , without ever thinking , everybody knew liked . “ I hate son bitch , ” Yossarian growled . The argument Clevinger begun minutes earlier Yossarian unable find machine gun . It busy night . The bar busy , crap table busy , ping-gong table busy . The people Yossarian wanted machine-gun busy bar singing sentimental old favorites nobody else ever tired . Instead machine-gunning , brought heel hard ping-pong ball came rolling toward paddle one two officers playing . “ That Yossarian , ” two officers laughed , shaking heads , got another ball box shelf . “ That Yossarian , ” Yossarian answered . “ Yossarian , ” Nately whispered cautioningly . “ You see I mean ? ” asked Clevinger . The officers laughed heard Yossarian mimicking . “ That Yossarian , ” said loudly . “ That Yossarian , ” Yossarian echoed . “ Yossarian , please , ” Nately pleaded . “ You see I mean ? ” asked Clevinger . “ He antisocial aggressions. ” “ Oh , shut , ” Dunbar told Clevinger . Dunbar liked Clevinger Clevinger annoyed made time go slow . “ Appleby ’ even , ” Clevinger pointed triumphantly Yossarian . “ Who said anything Appleby ? ” Yossarian wanted know . “ Colonel Cathcart ’ , either. ” “ Who said anything Colonel Cathcart ? ” “ What son bitch hate , ? ” “ What son bitch ? ” “ I ’ going argue , ” Clevinger decided . “ You ’ know hate. ” “ Whoever ’ trying poison , ” Yossarian told . “ Nobody ’ trying poison you. ” “ They poisoned food twice , ’ ? Didn ’ put poison food Ferrara Great Big Siege Bologna ? ” “ They put poison everybody ’ food , ” Clevinger explained . “ And difference make ? ” “ And ’ even poison ! ” Clevinger cried heatedly , growing emphatic grew confused . As far back Yossarian could recall , explained Clevinger patient smile , somebody always hatching plot kill . There people cared people ’ , ’ hated get . They hated Assyrian . But ’ touch , told Clevinger , sound mind pure body strong ox . They ’ touch Tarzan , Mandrake , Flash Gordon . He Bill Shakespeare . He Cain , Ulysses , Flying Dutchman ; Lot Sodom , Deirdre Sorrows , Sweeney nightingales among trees . He miracle ingredient Z-247 . He was- “ Crazy ! ” Clevinger interrupted , shrieking . “ That ’ ! Crazy ! ” “ -immense . I ’ real , slam-bang , honest-to-goodness , three-fisted humdinger . I ’ bona fide supraman. ” “ Superman ? ” Clevinger cried . “ Superman ? ” “ Supraman , ” Yossarian corrected . “ Hey , fellas , cut , ” Nately begged embarrassment . “ Everybody ’ looking us. ” “ You ’ crazy , ” Clevinger shouted vehemently , eyes filling tears . “ You ’ got Jehovah complex. ” “ I think everyone Nathaniel. ” Clevinger arrested mid-declamation , suspiciously . “ Who ’ Nathaniel ? ” “ Nathaniel ? ” inquired Yossarian innocently . Clevinger skirted trap neatly . “ You think everybody Jehovah . You ’ better Raskolnkov- “ “ Who ? ” “ -yes , Raskolnikov , who- “ “ Raskolnikov ! ” “ -who-I mean it-who felt could justify killing old woman- “ “ No better ? ” “ -yes , justify , ’ right-with ax ! And I prove ! ” Gasping furiously air , Clevinger enumerated Yossarian ’ symptoms : unreasonable belief everybody around crazy , homicidal impulse machine-gun strangers , retrospective falsification , unfounded suspicion people hated conspiring kill . But Yossarian knew right , , explained Clevinger , best knowledge never wrong . Everywhere looked nut , sensible young gentleman like could maintain perspective amid much madness . And urgent , knew life peril . Yossarian eyed everyone saw warily returned squadron hospital . Milo away , , Smyrna fig harvest . The mess hall ran smoothly Milo ’ absence . Yossarian responded ravenously pungent aroma spicy lamb still cab ambulance bouncing along knotted road lay like broken suspender hospital squadron . There shish-kabob lunch , huge , savory hunks spitted meat sizzling like devil charcoal marinating seventy-two hours secret mixture Milo stolen crooked trader Levant , served Iranian rice asparagus tips Parmesan , followed cherries jubilee dessert steaming cups fresh coffee Benedictine brandy . The meal served enormous helpings damask tablecloths skilled Italian waiters Major -- de Coverley kidnaped mainland given Milo . Yossarian gorged mess hall thought would explode sagged back contented stupor , mouth filmy succulent residue . None officers squadron ever eaten well ate regularly Milo ’ mess hall , Yossarian wondered awhile ’ perhaps worth . But burped remembered trying kill , sprinted mess hall wildly ran looking Doc Daneeka taken combat duty sent home . He found Doc Daneeka sunlight , sitting high stool outside tent . “ Fifty missions , ” Doc Daneeka told , shaking head . “ The colonel wants fifty missions. ” “ But I ’ got forty-four ! ” Doc Daneeka unmoved . He sad , birdlike man spatulate face scrubbed , tapering features well-groomed rat . “ Fifty missions , ” repeated , still shaking head . “ The colonel wants fifty missions. ” 3 HAVERMEYER Actually , one around Yossarian returned hospital Orr dead man Yossarian ’ tent . The dead man Yossarian ’ tent pest , Yossarian ’ like , even though never seen . Having lying around day annoyed Yossarian much gone orderly room several times complain Sergeant Towser , refused admit dead man even existed , , course , longer . It still frustrating try appeal directly Major Major , long bony squadron commander , looked little bit like Henry Fonda distress went jumping window office time Yossarian bullied way past Sergeant Towser speak . The dead man Yossarian ’ tent simply easy live . He even disturbed Orr , easy live , either , , day Yossarian came back , tinkering faucet fed gasoline stove started building Yossarian hospital . “ What ? ” Yossarian asked guardedly entered tent , although saw . “ There ’ leak , ” Orr said . “ I ’ trying fix it. ” “ Please stop , ” said Yossarian . “ You ’ making nervous. ” “ When I kid , ” Orr replied , “ I used walk around day crab apples cheeks . One cheek. ” Yossarian put aside musette bag begun removing toilet articles braced suspiciously . A minute passed . “ Why ? ” found forced ask finally . Orr tittered triumphantly . “ Because ’ better horse chestnuts , ” answered . Orr kneeling floor tent . He worked without pause , taking faucet apart , spreading tiny pieces carefully , counting studying one interminably though never seen anything remotely similar , reassembling whole apparatus , , loss patience interest , sign fatigue , indication ever concluding . Yossarian watched tinkering felt certain would compelled murder cold blood stop . His eyes moved toward hunting knife slung mosquito-net bar dead man day arrived . The knife hung beside dead man ’ empty leather gun holster , Havermeyer stolen gun . “ When I ’ get crab apples , ” Orr continued , “ I used horse chestnuts . Horse chestnuts size crab apples actually better shape , although shape ’ matter bit. ” “ Why walk around crab apples cheeks ? ” Yossarian asked . “ That ’ I asked. ” “ Because ’ got better shape horse chestnuts , ” Orr answered . “ I told that. ” “ Why , ” swore Yossarian approvingly , “ evil-eyed , mechanically-aptituded , disaffiliated son bitch , walk around anything cheeks ? ” “ I ’ , ” Orr said , “ walk around anything cheeks . I walked around crab apples cheeks . When I ’ get crab apples I walked around horse chestnuts . In cheeks. ” Orr giggled . Yossarian made mind keep mouth shut . Orr waited . Yossarian waited longer . “ One cheek , ” Orr said . “ Why ? ” Orr pounced . “ Why ? ” Yossarian shook head , smiling , refused say . “ It ’ funny thing valve , ” Orr mused aloud . “ What ? ” Yossarian asked . “ Because I wanted- “ Yossarian knew . “ Jesus Christ ! Why want- “ “ -apple cheeks. ” “ -apple cheeks ? ” Yossarian demanded . “ I wanted apple cheeks , ” Orr repeated . “ Even I kid I wanted apple cheeks someday , I decided work I got , God , I work I got , ’ I , crab apples cheeks day long. ” He giggled . “ One cheek. ” “ Why want apple cheeks ? ” “ I ’ want apple cheeks , ” Orr said . “ I wanted big cheeks . I ’ care color much , I wanted big . I worked like one crazy guys read go around squeezing rubber balls day long strengthen hands . In fact , I one crazy guys . I used walk around day rubber balls hands , too. ” “ Why ? ” “ Why ? ” “ Why walk around day rubber balls hands ? ” “ Because rubber balls- “ said Orr . “ -are better crab apples ? ” Orr sniggered shook head . “ I protect good reputation case anyone ever caught walking around crab apples cheeks . With rubber balls hands I could deny crab apples cheeks . Every time someone asked I walking around crab apples cheeks , I ’ open hands show rubber balls I walking around , crab apples , hands , cheeks . It good story . But I never knew got across , since ’ pretty tough make people understand ’ talking two crab apples cheeks. ” Yossarian found pretty tough understand , wondered Orr ’ talking tip tongue one apple cheeks . Yossarian decided utter another word . It would futile . He knew Orr , knew chance hell finding wanted big cheeks . It would good ask done ask whore kept beating head shoe morning Rome cramped vestibule outside open door Nately ’ whore ’ kid sister ’ room . She tall , strapping girl long hair incandescent blue veins converging populously beneath cocoa-colored skin flesh tender , kept cursing shrieking jumping high air bare feet keep right hitting top head spiked heel shoe . They naked , raising rumpus brought everyone apartment hall watch , couple bedroom doorway , naked except aproned sweatered old woman , clucked reprovingly , lecherous , dissipated old man , cackled aloud hilariously whole episode kind avid superior glee . The girl shrieked Orr giggled . Each time landed heel shoe , Orr giggled louder , infuriating still flew still higher air another shot noodle , wondrously full breasts soaring place like billowing pennants strong wind buttocks strong thighs shim-sham-shimmying way way like horrifying bonanza . She shrieked Orr giggled right time shrieked knocked cold good solid crack temple made stop giggling sent hospital stretcher hole head ’ deep mild concussion kept combat twelve days . Nobody could find happened , even cackling old man clucking old woman , position find everything happened vast endless brothel multitudinous bedrooms facing sides narrow hallways going opposite directions spacious sitting room shaded windows single lamp . Every time met Orr , ’ hoist skirts tight white elastic panties , jeering coarsely , bulge firm , round belly , cursing contemptuously roaring husky laughter saw giggle fearfully take refuge behind Yossarian . Whatever done tried failed behind closed door Nately ’ whore ’ kid sister ’ room still secret . The girl ’ tell Nately ’ whore whores Nately Yossarian . Orr might tell , Yossarian decided utter another word . “ Do want know I wanted big cheeks ? ” Orr asked . Yossarian kept mouth shut . “ Do remember , ” Orr said , “ time Rome girl ’ stand kept hitting head heel shoe ? Do want know hitting ? ” It still impossible imagine could done make angry enough hammer head fifteen twenty minutes , yet angry enough pick ankles dash brains . She certainly tall enough , Orr certainly short enough . Orr buck teeth bulging eyes go big cheeks even smaller young Huple , lived wrong side railroad tracks tent administration area Hungry Joe lay screaming sleep every night . The administration area Hungry Joe pitched tent mistake lay center squadron ditch , rusted railroad tracks , tilted black bituminous road . The men could pick girls along road promised take wanted go , buxom , young , homely , grinning girls missing teeth could drive road lie wild grass , Yossarian whenever could , nearly often Hungry Joe , could get jeep ’ drive , begged try . The tents enlisted men squadron stood side road alongside open-air movie theater , daily amusement dying , ignorant armies clashed night collapsible screen , another U.S.O . troupe came afternoon . The U.S.O . troupes sent General P. P. Peckem , moved headquarters Rome nothing better schemed General Dreedle . General Peckem general neatness definitely counted . He spry , suave precise general knew circumference equator always wrote “ enhanced ” meant “ increased ” . He prick , one knew better General Dreedle , incensed General Peckem ’ recent directive requiring tents Mediterranean theater operations pitched along parallel lines entrances facing back proudly toward Washington Monument . To General Dreedle , ran fighting outfit , seemed lot crap . Furthermore , none General Peckem ’ goddam business tents General Dreedle ’ wing pitched . There followed hectic jurisdictional dispute overlords decided General Dreedle ’ favor ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , mail clerk Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters . Wintergreen determined outcome throwing communications General Peckem wastebasket . He found prolix . General Dreedle ’ views , expressed less pretentious literary style , pleased ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen sped along zealous observance regulations . General Dreedle victorious default . To regain whatever status lost , General Peckem began sending U.S.O . troupes ever sent assigned Colonel Cargill responsibility generating enough enthusiasm . But enthusiasm Yossarian ’ group . In Yossarian ’ group mounting number enlisted men officers found way solemnly Sergeant Towser several times day ask orders sending home come . They men finished fifty missions . There Yossarian gone hospital , still waiting . They worried bit nails . They grotesque , like useless young men depression . They moved sideways , like crabs . They waiting orders sending home safety return Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters Italy , waited nothing worry bite nails find way solemnly Sergeant Towser several times day ask order sending home safety come . They race knew , knew bitter experience Colonel Cathcart might raise number missions time . They nothing better wait . Only Hungry Joe something better time finished missions . He screaming nightmares fist fights Huple ’ cat . He took camera front row every U.S.O . show tried shoot pictures skirt yellow-headed singer two big ones sequined dress always seemed ready burst . The pictures never came . Colonel Cargill , General Peckem ’ troubleshooter , forceful , ruddy man . Before war alert , hardhitting , aggressive marketing executive . He bad marketing executive . Colonel Cargill awful marketing executive services much sought firms eager establish losses tax purposes . Throughout civilized world , Battery Park Fulton Street , known dependable man fast tax write-off . His prices high , failure often come easily . He start top work way , sympathetic friends Washington , losing money simple matter . It took months hard work careful misplanning . A person misplaced , disorganized , miscalculated , overlooked everything opened every loophole , thought made , government gave lake forest oilfield spoiled everything . Even handicaps , Colonel Cargill could relied run prosperous enterprise ground . He self-made man owed lack success nobody . “ Men , ” Colonel Cargill began Yossarian ’ squadron , measuring pauses carefully . “ You ’ American officers . The officers army world make statement . Think it. ” Sergeant Knight thought politely informed Colonel Cargill addressing enlisted men officers found waiting side squadron . Colonel Cargill thanked crisply glowed self-satisfaction strode across area . It made proud observe twenty-nine months service blunted genius ineptitude . “ Men , ” began address officers , measuring pauses carefully . “ You ’ American officers . The officers army world make statement . Think it. ” He waited moment permit think . “ These people guests ! ” shouted suddenly . “ They ’ traveled three thousand miles entertain . How going feel nobody wants go watch ? What ’ going happen morale ? Now , men , ’ skin behind . But girl wants play accordion today old enough mother . How would feel mother traveled three thousand miles play accordion troops ’ want watch ? How kid whose mother accordion player old enough going feel grows learns ? We know answer one . Now , men , ’ misunderstand . This voluntary , course . I ’ last colonel world order go U.S.O . show good time , I want every one ’ sick enough hospital go U.S.O . show right good time , ’ order ! ” Yossarian feel almost sick enough go back hospital , felt even sicker three combat missions later Doc Daneeka still shook melancholy head refused ground . “ You think ’ got troubles ? ” Doc Daneeka rebuked grievingly . “ What ? I lived peanuts eight years I learned doctor . After peanuts , I lived chicken feed office I could build practice decent enough even pay expenses . Then , shop finally starting show profit , drafted . I ’ know ’ complaining about. ” Doc Daneeka Yossarian ’ friend would nothing power help . Yossarian listened carefully Doc Daneeka told Colonel Cathcart Group , wanted general , General Dreedle Wing General Dreedle ’ nurse , generals Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters , insisted forty missions completed tour duty . “ Why ’ smile make best ? ” advised Yossarian glumly . “ Be like Havermeyer. ” Yossarian shuddered suggestion . Havermeyer lead bombardier never took evasive action going target thereby increased danger men flew formation . “ Havermeyer , hell ’ ever take evasive action ? ” would demand rage mission . “ Hey , men leave Captain Havermeyer alone , ” Colonel Cathcart would order . “ He ’ best damned bombardier ’ got. ” Havermeyer grinned nodded tried explain dumdummed bullets hunting knife fired field mice tent every night . Havermeyer best damned bombardier , flew straight level way I.P . target , even far beyond target saw falling bombs strike ground explode darting spurt abrupt orange flashed beneath swirling pall smoke pulverized debris geysering wildly huge , rolling waves gray black . Havermeyer held mortal men rigid six planes steady still sitting ducks followed bombs way plexiglass nose deep interest gave German gunners time needed set sights take aim pull triggers lanyards switches whatever hell pull wanted kill people ’ know . Havermeyer lead bombardier never missed . Yossarian lead bombardier demoted longer gave damn whether missed . He decided live forever die attempt , mission time went come alive . The men loved flying behind Yossarian , used come barreling target directions every height , climbing diving twisting turning steeply sharply pilots five planes could stay formation , leveling two three seconds took bombs drop zooming aching howl engines , wrenching flight air violently wove way filthy barrages flak six planes soon flung sky like prayers , one pushover German fighters , fine Yossarian , German fighters want exploding planes near exploded . Only Sturm und Drang left far behind would tip flak helmet back wearily sweating head stop barking directions McWatt controls , nothing better wonder time like bombs fallen . “ Bomb bay clear , ” Sergeant Knight back would announce . “ Did hit bridge ? ” McWatt would ask . “ I ’ see , sir , I kept getting bounced around back pretty hard I ’ see . Everything ’ covered smoke I ’ see. ” “ Hey , Aarfy , bombs hit target ? ” “ What target ? ” Captain Aardvaark , Yossarian ’ plump , pipe-smoking navigator , would say confusion maps created Yossarian ’ side nose ship . “ I ’ think ’ target yet . Are ? ” “ Yossarian , bombs hit target ? ” “ What bombs ? ” answered Yossarian , whose concern flak . “ Oh , well , ” McWatt would sing , “ hell. ” Yossarian give damn whether hit target , long Havermeyer one lead bombardiers never go back . Every someone grew angry enough Havermeyer throw punch . “ I said men leave Captain Havermeyer alone , ” Colonel Cathcart warned angrily . “ I said ’ best damned bombardier ’ got , ’ I ? ” Havermeyer grinned colonel ’ intervention shoved another piece peanut brittle inside face . Havermeyer grown proficient shooting field mice night gun stolen dead man Yossarian ’ tent . His bait bar candy would presight darkness sat waiting nibble finger hand inside loop line run frame mosquito net chain unfrosted light bulb overhead . The line taut banjo string , merest tug would snap blind shivering quarry blaze light . Havermeyer would chortle exultantly watched tiny mammal freeze roll terrified eyes frantic search intruder . Havermeyer would wait eyes fell upon laughed aloud pulled trigger time , showering rank , furry body tent reverberating crash dispatching timid soul back Creator . Late one night , Havermeyer fired shot mouse brought Hungry Joe bolting barefoot , ranting top screechy voice emptying own.45 Havermeyer ’ tent came charging one side ditch vanished inside one slit trenches appeared like magic beside every tent morning Milo Minderbinder bombed squadron . It dawn Great Big Siege Bologna , tongueless dead men peopled night hours like living ghosts Hungry Joe half mind finished missions scheduled fly . Hungry Joe babbling incoherently fished dank bottom slit trench , babbling snakes , rats spiders . The others flashed searchlights make sure . There nothing inside inches stagnant rain water . “ You see ? ” cried Havermeyer . “ I told . I told crazy , ’ I ? ” 4 DOC DANEEKA Hungry Joe crazy , one knew better Yossarian , everything could help . Hungry Joe ’ listen Yossarian . Hungry Joe ’ listen thought Yossarian crazy . “ Why listen ? ” Doc Daneeka inquired Yossarian without looking . “ Because ’ got troubles. ” Doc Daneeka snorted scornfully . “ He thinks ’ got troubles ? What ? ” Doc Daneeka continued slowly gloomy sneer . “ Oh , I ’ complaining . I know ’ war . I know lot people going suffer us win . But must I one ? Why ’ draft old doctors keep shooting kissers public big sacrifices medical game stands ready make ? I ’ want make sacrifices . I want make dough. ” Doc Daneeka neat , clean man whose idea good time sulk . He dark complexion small , wise , saturnine face mournful pouches eyes . He brooded health continually went almost daily medical tent temperature taken one two enlisted men ran things practically , ran efficiently left little else sit sunlight stuffed nose wonder people worried . Their names Gus Wes succeeded elevating medicine exact science . All men reporting sick call temperatures 102 rushed hospital . All except Yossarian reporting sick call temperatures 102 gums toes painted gentian violet solution given laxative throw away bushes . All reporting sick call temperatures exactly 102 asked return hour temperatures taken . Yossarian , temperature 101 , could go hospital whenever wanted afraid . The system worked fine everybody , especially Doc Daneeka , found time needed watch old Major -- de Coverley pitching horseshoes private horseshoe-pitching pit , still wearing transparent eye patch Doc Daneeka fashioned strip celluloid stolen Major Major ’ orderly room window months Major -- de Coverley returned Rome injured cornea renting two apartments officers enlisted men use rest leaves . The time Doc Daneeka ever went medical tent time began feel sick man day stopped Gus Wes look . They could never find anything wrong . His temperature always 96.8 , perfectly right , long ’ mind . Doc Daneeka mind . He beginning lose confidence Gus Wes thinking transferred back motor pool replaced someone could find something wrong . Doc Daneeka personally familiar number things drastically wrong . In addition health , worried Pacific Ocean flight time . Health something one ever could sure long enough time . The Pacific Ocean body water surrounded sides elephantiasis dread diseases , ever displeased Colonel Cathcart grounding Yossarian , might suddenly find transferred . And flight time time spend airplane flight month order get flight pay . Doc Daneeka hated fly . He felt imprisoned airplane . In airplane absolutely place world go except another part airplane . Doc Daneeka told people enjoyed climbing airplane really giving vent subconscious desire climb back womb . He told Yossarian , made possible Dan Daneeka collect flight pay month without ever climbing back womb . Yossarian would persuade McWatt enter Doc Daneeka ’ name flight log training missions trips Rome . “ You know , ” Doc Daneeka wheedled , sly , conspiratorial wink . “ Why take chances I ’ ? ” “ Sure , ” Yossarian agreed . “ What difference make anyone I ’ plane ? ” “ No difference. ” “ Sure , ’ I mean , ” Doc Daneeka said . “ A little grease makes world go round . One hand washes . Know I mean ? You scratch back , I ’ scratch yours. ” Yossarian knew meant . “ That ’ I meant , ” Doc Daneeka said , Yossarian began scratching back . “ I ’ talking co-operation . Favors . You favor , I ’ one . Get ? ” “ Do one , ” Yossarian requested . “ Not chance , ” Doc Daneeka answered . There something fearful minute Doc Daneeka sat despondently outside tent sunlight often could , dressed khaki summer trousers short-sleeved summer shirt bleached almost antiseptic gray daily laundering subjected . He like man grown frozen horror never come completely unthawed . He sat tucked , slender shoulders huddled halfway around head , suntanned hands luminous silver fingernails massaging backs bare , folded arms gently though cold . Actually , warm , compassionate man never stopped feeling sorry . “ Why ? ” constant lament , question good one . Yossarian knew good one Yossarian collector good questions used disrupt educational sessions Clevinger conducted two nights week Captain Black ’ intelligence tent corporal eyeglasses everybody knew probably subversive . Captain Black knew subversive wore eyeglasses used words like panacea utopia , disapproved Adolf Hitler , done great job combating un-American activities Germany . Yossarian attended educational sessions wanted find many people working hard kill . A handful men also interested , questions many good Clevinger subversive corporal finished made mistake asking . “ Who Spain ? ” “ Why Hitler ? ” “ When right ? ” “ Where stooped mealy-colored old man I used call Poppa merry-go-round broke ? ” “ How trump Munich ? ” “ Ho-ho beriberi. ” “ Balls ! ” rang rapid succession , Yossarian question answer : “ Where Snowdens yesteryear ? ” The question upset , Snowden killed Avignon Dobbs went crazy mid-air seized controls away Huple . The corporal played dumb . “ What ? ” asked . “ Where Snowdens yesteryear ? ” “ I ’ afraid I ’ understand. ” “ Où sont les Neigedens ’ antan ? ” Yossarian said make easier . “ Parlez en anglais , Christ ’ sake , ” said corporal . “ Je ne parle pas français. ” “ Neither I , ” answered Yossarian , ready pursue words world wring knowledge could , Clevinger intervened , pale , thin , laboring breath , humid coating tears already glistening undernourished eyes . Group Headquarters alarmed , telling people might find felt free ask whatever questions wanted . Colonel Cathcart sent Colonel Korn stop , Colonel Korn succeeded rule governing asking questions . Colonel Korn ’ rule stroke genius , Colonel Korn explained report Colonel Cathcart . Under Colonel Korn ’ rule , people permitted ask questions never . Soon people attending never asked questions , sessions discontinued altogether , since Clevinger , corporal Colonel Korn agreed neither possible necessary educate people never questioned anything . Colonel Cathcart Lieutenant Colonel Korn lived worked Group Headquarters building , members headquarters staff , exception chaplain . The Group Headquarters building enormous , windy , antiquated structure built powdery red stone banging plumbing . Behind building modern skeet-shooting range constructed Colonel Cathcart exclusive recreation officers Group every officer enlisted man combat status , thanks General Dreedle , spend minimum eight hours month . Yossarian shot skeet , never hit . Appleby shot skeet never missed . Yossarian bad shooting skeet gambling . He could never win money gambling either . Even cheated ’ win , people cheated always better cheating . These two disappointments resigned : would never skeet shooter , would never make money . “ It takes brains make money , ” Colonel Cargill wrote one homiletic memoranda regularly prepared circulation General Peckem ’ signature . “ Any fool make money days . But people talent brains ? Name , example , one poet makes money. ” “ T . S. Eliot , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen said mail-sorting cubicle Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters , slammed telephone without identifying . Colonel Cargill , Rome , perplexed . “ Who ? ” asked General Peckem . “ I ’ know , ” Colonel Cargill replied . “ What want ? ” “ I ’ know. ” “ Well , say ? ” “ ’ T . S. Eliot , ’ ” Colonel Cargill informed . “ What ’ ? ” “ ’ T . S. Eliot , ’ ” Colonel Cargill repeated . “ Just ‘ T . S. ’ - “ “ Yes , sir . That ’ said . Just ‘ T . S. Eliot. ’ ” “ I wonder means , ” General Peckem reflected . Colonel Cargill wondered , . “ T . S. Eliot , ” General Peckem mused . “ T . S. Eliot , ” Colonel Cargill echoed funereal puzzlement . General Peckem roused moment unctuous benignant smile . His expression shrewd sophisticated . His eyes gleamed maliciously . “ Have someone get General Dreedle , ” requested Colonel Cargill . “ Don ’ let know ’ calling. ” Colonel Cargill handed phone . “ T . S. Eliot , ” General Peckem said , hung . “ Who ? ” asked Colonel Moodus . General Dreedle , Corsica , reply . Colonel Moodus General Dreedle ’ son-in-law , General Dreedle , insistence wife better judgment , taken military business . General Dreedle gazed Colonel Moodus level hatred . He detested sight son-in-law , aide therefore constant attendance upon . He opposed daughter ’ marriage Colonel Moodus disliked attending weddings . Wearing menacing preoccupied scowl , General Dreedle moved full-length mirror office stared stocky reflection . He grizzled , broad-browed head iron-gray tufts eyes blunt belligerent jaw . He brooded ponderous speculation cryptic message received . Slowly face softened idea , curled lips wicked pleasure . “ Get Peckem , ” told Colonel Moodus . “ Don ’ let bastard know ’ calling. ” “ Who ? ” asked Colonel Cargill , back Rome . “ That person , ” General Peckem replied definite trace alarm . “ Now ’ me. ” “ What want ? ” “ I ’ know. ” “ What say ? ” “ The thing. ” “ ’ T . S. Eliot ’ ? ” “ Yes , ‘ T . S. Eliot. ’ That ’ said. ” General Peckem hopeful thought . “ Perhaps ’ new code something , like colors day . Why ’ someone check Communications see ’ new code something colors day ? ” Communications answered T. S. Eliot new code colors day . Colonel Cargill next idea . “ Maybe I ought phone Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters see know anything . They clerk named Wintergreen I ’ pretty close . He ’ one tipped prose prolix. ” Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen told Cargill record Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters T. S. Eliot . “ How ’ prose days ? ” Colonel Cargill decided inquire ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen phone . “ It ’ much better , ’ ? ” “ It ’ still prolix , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen replied . “ It ’ surprise General Dreedle behind whole thing , ” General Peckem confessed last . “ Remember skeet-shooting range ? ” General Dreedle thrown open Colonel Cathcart ’ private skeet-shooting range every officer enlisted man group combat duty . General Dreedle wanted men spend much time skeet-shooting range facilities flight schedule would allow . Shooting skeet eight hours month excellent training . It trained shoot skeet . Dunbar loved shooting skeet hated every minute time passed slowly . He figured single hour skeet-shooting range people like Havermeyer Appleby could worth much eleven-times-seventeen years . “ I think ’ crazy , ” way Clevinger responded Dunbar ’ discovery . “ Who wants know ? ” Dunbar answered . “ I mean , ” Clevinger insisted . “ Who cares ? ” Dunbar answered . “ I really . I ’ even go far concede life seems longer I- “ “ -is longer I- “ “ -is longer-Is longer ? All right , longer ’ filled periods boredom discomfort , b- “ “ Guess fast ? ” Dunbar said suddenly . “ Huh ? ” “ They go , ” Dunbar explained . “ Years. ” “ Years. ” “ Years , ” said Dunbar . “ Years , years , years. ” “ Clevinger , ’ let Dunbar alone ? ” Yossarian broke . “ Don ’ realize toll taking ? ” “ It ’ right , ” said Dunbar magnanimously . “ I decades spare . Do know long year takes ’ going away ? ” “ And shut also , ” Yossarian told Orr , begun snigger . “ I thinking girl , ” Orr said . “ That girl Sicily . That girl Sicily bald head. ” “ You ’ better shut also , ” Yossarian warned . “ It ’ fault , ” Dunbar said Yossarian . “ Why ’ let snigger wants ? It ’ better talking. ” “ All right . Go ahead snigger want to. ” “ Do know long year takes ’ going away ? ” Dunbar repeated Clevinger . “ This long. ” He snapped fingers . “ A second ago stepping college lungs full fresh air . Today ’ old man. ” “ Old ? ” asked Clevinger surprise . “ What talking ? ” “ Old. ” “ I ’ old. ” “ You ’ inches away death every time go mission . How much older age ? A half minute stepping high school , unhooked brassiere close ever hoped get Paradise . Only fifth second small kid ten-week summer vacation lasted hundred thousand years still ended soon . Zip ! They go rocketing fast . How hell else ever going slow time ? ” Dunbar almost angry finished . “ Well , maybe true , ” Clevinger conceded unwillingly subdued tone . “ Maybe long life filled many unpleasant conditions ’ seem long . But event , wants one ? ” “ I , ” Dunbar told . “ Why ? ” Clevinger asked . “ What else ? ” 5 CHIEF WHITE HALFOAT Doc Daneeka lived splotched gray tent Chief White Halfoat , feared despised . “ I picture liver , ” Doc Daneeka grumbled . “ Picture liver , ” Yossarian advised . “ There ’ nothing wrong liver. ” “ That shows much ’ know , ” Yossarian bluffed , told Doc Daneeka troublesome pain liver troubled Nurse Duckett Nurse Cramer doctors hospital ’ become jaundice ’ go away . Doc Daneeka ’ interested . “ You think ’ got troubles ? ” wanted know . “ What ? You ’ office day newlyweds walked in. ” “ What newlyweds ? ” “ Those newlyweds walked office one day . Didn ’ I ever tell ? She lovely. ” So Doc Daneeka ’ office . He decorated waiting room goldfish one finest suites cheap furniture . Whatever could bought credit , even goldfish . For rest , obtained money greedy relatives exchange shares profits . His office Staten Island two-family firetrap four blocks away ferry stop one block south supermarket , three beauty parlors , two corrupt druggists . It corner location , nothing helped . Population turnover small , people clung habit physicians business years . Bills piled rapidly , soon faced loss precious medical instruments : adding machine repossessed , typewriter . The goldfish died . Fortunately , things blackest , war broke . “ It godsend , ” Doc Daneeka confessed solemnly . “ Most doctors soon service , things picked overnight . The corner location really started paying , I soon found handling patients I could handle competently . I upped kickback fee two drugstores . The beauty parlors good two , three abortions week . Things ’ better , look happened . They send guy draft board around look . I Four-F . I examined pretty thoroughly discovered I unfit military service .

But , ’ , sent guy around make sure I really one leg amputated hip helplessly bedridden incurable rheumatoid arthritis . Yossarian , live age distrust deteriorating spiritual values . It ’ terrible thing , ” Doc Daneeka protested voice quavering strong emotion . “ It ’ terrible thing even word licensed physician suspected country loves. ” Doc Daneeka drafted shipped Pianosa flight surgeon , even though terrified flying . “ I ’ go looking trouble airplane , ” noted , blinking beady , brown , offended eyes myopically . “ It comes looking . Like virgin I ’ telling ’ baby. ” “ What virgin ? ” Yossarian asked . “ I thought telling newlyweds. ” “ That ’ virgin I ’ telling . They couple young kids , ’ married , oh , little year came walking office without appointment . You seen . She sweet young pretty . She even blushed I asked periods . I ’ think I ’ ever stop loving girl . She built like dream wore chain around neck medal Saint Anthony hanging inside beautiful bosom I never saw . ‘ It must terrible temptation Saint Anthony , ’ I joked-just put ease , know . ‘ Saint Anthony ? ’ husband said . ‘ Who ’ Saint Anthony ? ’ ‘ Ask wife , ’ I told . ‘ She tell Saint Anthony is. ’ ‘ Who Saint Anthony ? ’ asked . ‘ Who ? ’ wanted know . ‘ Saint Anthony , ’ told . ‘ Saint Anthony ? ’ said . ‘ Who ’ Saint Anthony ? ’ When I got good look inside examination room I found still virgin .

A days later came back told nurse see right away . As soon alone , punched nose. ” “ He ? ” “ He called wise guy punched nose . ‘ What , wise guy ? ’ said , knocked flat ass . Pow ! Just like . I ’ kidding. ” “ I know ’ kidding , ” Yossarian said . “ But ? ” “ How I know ? ” Doc Daneeka retorted annoyance . “ Maybe something Saint Anthony ? ” Doc Daneeka looked Yossarian blankly . “ Saint Anthony ? ” asked astonishment . “ Who ’ Saint Anthony ? ” “ How I know ? ” answered Chief White Halfoat , staggering inside tent bottle whiskey cradled arm sitting pugnaciously two . Doc Daneeka rose without word moved chair outside tent , back bowed compact kit injustices perpetual burden . He could bear company roommate . Chief White Halfoat thought crazy . “ I ’ know ’ matter guy , ” observed reproachfully . “ He ’ got brains , ’ ’ matter . If brains ’ grab shovel start digging . Right tent , ’ start digging , right cot . He ’ strike oil time . Don ’ know enlisted man struck oil shovel back States ? Didn ’ ever hear happened kid-what name rotten rat bastard pimp snotnose back Colorado ? ” “ Wintergreen. ” “ Wintergreen. ” “ He ’ afraid , ” Yossarian explained . “ Oh , . Not Wintergreen. ” Chief White Halfoat shook head undisguised admiration . “ That stinking little punk wise-guy son bitch ’ afraid nobody. ” “ Doc Daneeka ’ afraid . That ’ ’ matter him. ” “ What ’ afraid ? ” “ He ’ afraid , ” Yossarian said . “ He ’ afraid ’ going die pneumonia. ” “ He ’ better afraid , ” Chief White Halfoat said . A deep , low laugh rumbled massive chest . “ I , , first chance I get . You wait see. ” Chief White Halfoat handsome , swarthy Indian Oklahoma heavy , hard-boned face tousled black hair , half-blooded Creek Enid , occult reasons , made mind die pneumonia . He glowering , vengeful , disillusioned Indian hated foreigners names like Cathcart , Korn , Black Havermeyer wished ’ go back lousy ancestors come . “ You ’ believe , Yossarian , ” ruminated , raising voice deliberately bait Doc Daneeka , “ used pretty good country live loused goddam piety. ” Chief White Halfoat revenge upon white man . He could barely read write assigned Captain Black assistant intelligence officer . “ How could I learn read write ? ” Chief White Halfoat demanded simulated belligerence , raising voice Doc Daneeka would hear . “ Every place pitched tent , sank oil well . Every time sank well , hit oil . And every time hit oil , made us pack tent go someplace else . We human divining rods . Our whole family natural affinity petroleum deposits , soon every oil company world technicians chasing us around . We always move . It one hell way bring child , I tell . I ’ think I ever spent week one place. ” His earliest memory geologist . “ Every time another White Halfoat born , ” continued , “ stock market turned bullish . Soon whole drilling crews following us around equipment get jump . Companies began merge could cut number people assign us . But crowd back us kept growing . We never got good night ’ sleep . When stopped , stopped . When moved , moved , chuckwagons , bulldozers , derricks , generators . We walking business boom , began receive invitations best hotels amount business would drag town us . Some invitations mighty generous , ’ accept Indians best hotels inviting us ’ accept Indians guests . Racial prejudice terrible thing , Yossarian . It really . It ’ terrible thing treat decent , loyal Indian like nigger , kike , wop spic. ” Chief White Halfoat nodded slowly conviction . “ Then , Yossarian , finally happened-the beginning end . They began follow us around front . They would try guess going stop next would begin drilling even got , ’ stop . As soon ’ begin unroll blankets , would kick us . They confidence us . They ’ even wait strike oil kicked us . We tired almost ’ care day time ran . One morning found completely surrounded oilmen waiting us come way could kick us . Everywhere looked oilman ridge , waiting like Indians getting ready attack . It end . We ’ stay kicked . And place left us go . Only Army saved . Luckily , war broke nick time , draft board picked right middle put safely Lowery Field , Colorado . I survivor. ” Yossarian knew lying , interrupt Chief White Halfoat went claim never heard parents . That ’ bother much , though , word parents , since lied many things , could well lying . He much better acquainted fate tribe first cousins wandered away north diversionary movement pushed inadvertently Canada . When tried return , stopped border American immigration authorities would let back country . They could come back red . It horrible joke , Doc Daneeka ’ laugh Yossarian came one mission later pleaded , without real expectation success , grounded . Doc Daneeka snickered soon immersed problems , included Chief White Halfoat , challenging morning Indian wrestle , Yossarian , decided right go crazy . “ You ’ wasting time , ” Doc Daneeka forced tell . “ Can ’ ground someone ’ crazy ? ” “ Oh , sure . I . There ’ rule saying I ground anyone ’ crazy. ” “ Then ’ ground ? I ’ crazy . Ask Clevinger. ” “ Clevinger ? Where Clevinger ? You find Clevinger I ’ ask him. ” “ Then ask others . They ’ tell crazy I am. ” “ They ’ crazy. ” “ Then ’ ground ? ” “ Why ’ ask ground ? ” “ Because ’ crazy , ’ why. ” “ Of course ’ crazy , ” Doc Daneeka replied . “ I told ’ crazy , ’ I ? And ’ let crazy people decide whether ’ crazy , ? ” Yossarian looked soberly tried another approach . “ Is Orr crazy ? ” “ He sure , ” Doc Daneeka said . “ Can ground ? ” “ I sure . But first ask . That ’ part rule. ” “ Then ’ ask ? ” “ Because ’ crazy , ” Doc Daneeka said . “ He crazy keep flying combat missions close calls ’ . Sure , I ground Orr . But first ask to. ” “ That ’ grounded ? ” “ That ’ . Let ask me. ” “ And ground ? ” Yossarian asked . “ No . Then I ’ ground him. ” “ You mean ’ catch ? ” “ Sure ’ catch , ” Doc Daneeka replied . “ Catch-22 . Anyone wants get combat duty ’ really crazy. ” There one catch Catch-22 , specified concern one ’ safety face dangers real immediate process rational mind . Orr crazy could grounded . All ask ; soon , would longer crazy would fly missions . Orr would crazy fly missions sane ’ , sane fly . If flew crazy ’ ; ’ want sane . Yossarian moved deeply absolute simplicity clause Catch-22 let respectful whistle . “ That ’ catch , Catch-22 , ” observed . “ It ’ best , ” Doc Daneeka agreed . Yossarian saw clearly spinning reasonableness . There elliptical precision perfect pairs parts graceful shocking , like good modern art , times Yossarian ’ quite sure saw , way never quite sure good modern art flies Orr saw Appleby ’ eyes . He Orr ’ word take flies Appleby ’ eyes . “ Oh , ’ , right , ” Orr assured flies Appleby ’ eyes Yossarian ’ fist fight Appleby officers ’ club , “ although probably ’ even know . That ’ ’ see things really are. ” “ How come ’ know ? ” inquired Yossarian . “ Because ’ got flies eyes , ” Orr explained exaggerated patience . “ How see ’ got flies eyes ’ got flies eyes ? ” It made much sense anything else , Yossarian willing give Orr benefit doubt Orr wilderness outside New York City knew much wildlife Yossarian , Orr , unlike Yossarian ’ mother , father , sister , brother , aunt , uncle , in-law , teacher , spiritual leader , legislator , neighbor newspaper , never lied anything crucial . Yossarian mulled newfound knowledge Appleby private day two decided , good deed , pass word along Appleby . “ Appleby , ’ got flies eyes , ” whispered helpfully passed doorway parachute tent day weekly milk run Parma . “ What ? ” Appleby responded sharply , thrown confusion fact Yossarian spoken . “ You ’ got flies eyes , ” Yossarian repeated . “ That ’ probably ’ see them. ” Appleby retreated Yossarian look loathing bewilderment sulked silence jeep Havermeyer riding long , straight road briefing room , Major Danby , fidgeting group operations officer , waiting conduct preliminary briefing lead pilots , bombardiers navigators . Appleby spoke soft voice would heard driver Captain Black , stretched eyes closed front seat jeep . “ Havermeyer , ” asked hesitantly . “ Have I got flies eyes ? ” Havermeyer blinked quizzically . “ Sties ? ” asked . “ No , flies , ” told . Havermeyer blinked . “ Flies ? ” “ In eyes. ” “ You must crazy , ” Havermeyer said . “ No , I ’ crazy . Yossarian ’ crazy . Just tell I ’ got flies eyes . Go ahead . I take it. ” Havermeyer popped another piece peanut brittle mouth peered closely Appleby ’ eyes . “ I ’ see , ” announced . Appleby heaved immense sigh relief . Havermeyer tiny bits peanut brittle adhering lips , chin cheeks . “ You ’ got peanut brittle crumbs face , ” Appleby remarked . “ I ’ rather peanut brittle crumbs face flies eyes , ” Havermeyer retorted . The officers five planes flight arrived trucks general briefing took place thirty minutes later . The three enlisted men crew briefed , carried directly airfield separate planes scheduled fly day , waited around ground crew officers scheduled fly swung rattling tailgates trucks delivering time climb aboard start . Engines rolled disgruntedly lollipop-shaped hardstands , resisting first , idling smoothly awhile , planes lumbered around nosed forward lamely pebbled ground like sightless , stupid , crippled things taxied line foot landing strip took swiftly , one behind , zooming , rising roar , banking slowly formation mottled treetops , circling field even speed flights six formed setting course cerulean water first leg journey target northern Italy France .

Aarfy use Yossarian navigator anything else , Yossarian drove back nose vehemently time would clutter ’ way scramble suddenly safety . Once Yossarian driven back nose , Aarfy free cower floor Yossarian longed cower , stood bolt upright instead stumpy arms resting comfortably backs pilot ’ co-pilot ’ seats , pipe hand , making affable small talk McWatt whoever happened co-pilot pointing amusing trivia sky two men , busy interested . McWatt busy responding controls Yossarian ’ strident instructions Yossarian slipped plane bomb run whipped away violently around ravenous pillars exploding shells curt , shrill , obscene commands McWatt much like anguished , entreating nightmare yelpings Hungry Joe dark . Aarfy would puff reflectively pipe throughout whole chaotic clash , gazing unruffled curiosity war McWatt ’ window though remote disturbance could affect . Aarfy dedicated fraternity man loved cheerleading class reunions brains enough afraid .

At night eerie , ear-splitting nightmares kept everyone squadron awake Huple , fifteen-year-old pilot lied age get Army lived pet cat tent Hungry Joe . Huple light sleeper , claimed never heard Hungry Joe scream . Hungry Joe sick . “ So ? ” Doc Daneeka snarled resentfully . “ I made , I tell . Fifty grand year I knocking , almost tax-free , since I made customers pay cash . I strongest trade association world backing . And look happened . Just I set really start stashing away , manufacture fascism start war horrible enough affect even . I got ta laugh I hear someone like Hungry Joe screaming brains every night . I really got ta laugh . He ’ sick ? How think I feel ? ” Hungry Joe firmly embedded calamities care Doc Daneeka felt . There noises , instance . Small ones enraged hollered hoarse Aarfy wet , sucking sounds made puffing pipe , Orr tinkering , McWatt explosive snap gave card turned dealt blackjack poker , Dobbs letting teeth chatter went blundering clumsily bumping things . Hungry Joe throbbing , ragged mass motile irritability . The steady ticking watch quiet room crashed like torture unshielded brain . “ Listen , kid , ” explained harshly Huple late one evening , “ want live tent , ’ got like I . You ’ got roll wrist watch pair wool socks every night keep bottom foot locker side room. ” Huple thrust jaw defiantly let Hungry Joe know ’ pushed around exactly told . Hungry Joe jumpy , emaciated wretch fleshless face dingy skin bone twitching veins squirming subcutaneously blackened hollows behind eyes like severed sections snake . It desolate , cratered face , sooty care like abandoned mining town . Hungry Joe ate voraciously , gnawed incessantly tips fingers , stammered , choked , itched , sweated , salivated , sprang spot spot fanatically intricate black camera always trying take pictures naked girls . They never came . He always forgetting put film camera turn lights remove cover lens opening . It ’ easy persuading naked girls pose , Hungry Joe knack . “ Me big man , ” would shout . “ Me big photographer Life magazine . Big picture heap big cover . Si , si , si ! Hollywood star . Multi dinero . Multi divorces . Multi ficky-fick day long. ” Few women anywhere could resist wily cajolery , prostitutes would spring feet eagerly hurl whatever fantastic poses requested . Women killed Hungry Joe . His response sexual beings one frenzied worship idolatry . They lovely , satisfying , maddening manifestations miraculous , instruments pleasure powerful measured , keen endured , exquisite intended employment base , unworthy man . He could interpret naked presence hands cosmic oversight destined rectified speedily , driven always make carnal use could fleeting moment two felt Someone caught wise whisked away . He could never decide whether furgle photograph , found impossible simultaneously . In fact , finding almost impossible either , scrambled powers performance compulsive need haste invariably possessed . The pictures never came , Hungry Joe never got . The odd thing civilian life Hungry Joe really photographer Life magazine . He hero , biggest hero Air Force , Yossarian felt , flown combat tours duty hero Air Force . He flown six combat tours duty . Hungry Joe finished flying first combat tour duty twenty-five missions necessary pack bags , write happy letters home begin hounding Sergeant Towser humorously arrival orders rotating back States . While waited , spent day shuffling rhythmically around entrance operations tent , making boisterous wisecracks everybody came jocosely calling Sergeant Towser lousy son bitch every time Sergeant Towser popped orderly room . Hungry Joe finished flying first twenty-five missions week Salerno beachhead , Yossarian laid hospital burst clap caught low-level mission Wac bushes supply flight Marrakech . Yossarian best catch Hungry Joe almost , flying six missions six days , twenty-third mission Arezzo , Colonel Nevers killed , close ever able come going home . The next day Colonel Cathcart , brimming tough pride new outfit celebrating assumption command raising number missions required twenty-five thirty . Hungry Joe unpacked bags rewrote happy letters home . He stopped hounding Sergeant Towser humorously . He began hating Sergeant Towser , focusing blame upon venomously , even though knew Sergeant Towser nothing arrival Colonel Cathcart delay processing shipping orders might rescued seven days earlier five times since . Hungry Joe could longer stand strain waiting shipping orders crumbled promptly ruin every time finished another tour duty . Each time taken combat status , gave big party little circle friends . He broke bottles bourbon managed buy four-day weekly circuits courier plane laughed , sang , shuffled shouted festival inebriated ecstasy could longer keep awake receded peacefully slumber . As soon Yossarian , Nately Dunbar put bed began screaming sleep . In morning stepped tent looking haggard , fearful guilt-ridden , eaten shell human building rocking perilously brink collapse . The nightmares appeared Hungry Joe celestial punctuality every single night spent squadron throughout whole harrowing ordeal flying combat missions waiting orders sending home never came . Impressionable men squadron like Dobbs Captain Flume deeply disturbed Hungry Joe ’ shrieking nightmares would begin shrieking nightmares , piercing obscenities flung air every night separate places squadron rang darkness romantically like mating calls songbirds filthy minds . Colonel Korn acted decisively arrest seemed beginning unwholesome trend Major Major ’ squadron . The solution provided Hungry Joe fly courier ship week , removing squadron four nights , remedy , like Colonel Korn ’ remedies , successful . Every time Colonel Cathcart increased number missions returned Hungry Joe combat duty , nightmares stopped Hungry Joe settled normal state terror smile relief . Yossarian read Hungry Joe ’ shrunken face like headline . It good Hungry Joe looked bad terrible Hungry Joe looked good . Hungry Joe ’ inverted set responses curious phenomenon everyone Hungry Joe , denied whole thing stubbornly . “ Who dreams ? ” answered , Yossarian asked dreamed . “ Joe , ’ go see Doc Daneeka ? ” Yossarian advised . “ Why I go see Doc Daneeka ? I ’ sick. ” “ What nightmares ? ” “ I ’ nightmares , ” Hungry Joe lied . “ Maybe something them. ” “ There ’ nothing wrong nightmares , ” Hungry Joe answered . “ Everybody nightmares. ” Yossarian thought . “ Every night ? ” asked . “ Why every night ? ” Hungry Joe demanded . And suddenly made sense . Why every night , indeed ? It made sense cry pain every night . It made sense Appleby , stickler regulations ordered Kraft order Yossarian take Atabrine tablets flight overseas Yossarian Appleby stopped talking . Hungry Joe made sense Kraft , , dead , dumped unceremoniously doom Ferrara exploding engine Yossarian took flight six planes target second time . The group missed bridge Ferrara seventh straight day bombsight could put bombs pickle barrel forty thousand feet , one whole week already passed since Colonel Cathcart volunteered men destroy bridge twenty-four hours . Kraft skinny , harmless kid Pennsylvania wanted liked , destined disappointed even humble degrading ambition . Instead liked , dead , bleeding cinder barbarous pile nobody heard last precious moments plane one wing plummeted . He lived innocuously little gone flame Ferrara seventh day , God resting , McWatt turned Yossarian guided target second bomb run Aarfy confused Yossarian unable drop bombs first time . “ I guess go back , ’ ? ” McWatt said somberly intercom . “ I guess , ” said Yossarian . “ Do ? ” said McWatt . “ Yeah. ” “ Oh , well , ” sang McWatt , “ hell. ” And back gone planes flights circled safely distance every crashing cannon Hermann Goering Division busy crashing shells time . Colonel Cathcart courage never hesitated volunteer men target available . No target dangerous group attack , shot difficult Appleby handle ping-pong table . Appleby good pilot superhuman ping-pong player flies eyes never lost point . Twenty-one serves ever took Appleby disgrace another opponent . His prowess ping-pong table legendary , Appleby every game started night Orr got tipsy gin juice smashed open Appleby ’ forehead paddle Appleby smashed back Orr ’ first five serves . Orr leaped top table hurling paddle came sailing end running broad jump feet planted squarely Appleby ’ face . Pandemonium broke loose . It took almost full minute Appleby disentangle Orr ’ flailing arms legs grope way feet , Orr held ground shirt front one hand arm drawn back fist smite dead , moment Yossarian stepped forward took Orr away . It night surprises Appleby , large Yossarian strong swung Yossarian hard could punch flooded Chief White Halfoat joyous excitement turned busted Colonel Moodus nose punch filled General Dreedle mellow gratification Colonel Cathcart throw chaplain officers ’ club ordered Chief White Halfoat moved Doc Daneeka ’ tent , could doctor ’ care twenty-four hours day kept good enough physical condition bust Colonel Moodus nose whenever General Dreedle wanted . Sometimes General Dreedle made special trips Wing Headquarters Colonel Moodus nurse Chief White Halfoat bust son-in-law nose . Chief White Halfoat would much rather remained trailer shared Captain Flume , silent , haunted squadron public-relations officer spent evening developing pictures took day sent publicity releases . Captain Flume spent much evening could working darkroom lay cot fingers crossed rabbit ’ foot around neck tried might stay awake . He lived mortal fear Chief White Halfoat . Captain Flume obsessed idea Chief White Halfoat would tiptoe cot one night sound asleep slit throat open ear ear . Captain Flume obtained idea Chief White Halfoat , tiptoe cot one night dozing , hiss portentously one night , Captain Flume , sound asleep , Chief White Halfoat , going slit throat open ear ear . Captain Flume turned ice , eyes , flung open wide , staring directly Chief White Halfoat ’ , glinting drunkenly inches away . “ Why ? ” Captain Flume managed croak finally . “ Why ? ” Chief White Halfoat ’ answer . Each night , Captain Flume forced keep awake long possible . He aided immeasurably Hungry Joe ’ nightmares . Listening intently Hungry Joe ’ maniacal howling night night , Captain Flume grew hate began wishing Chief White Halfoat would tiptoe cot one night slit throat open ear ear . Actually , Captain Flume slept like log nights merely dreamed awake . So convincing dreams lying awake woke morning complete exhaustion fell right back sleep . Chief White Halfoat grown almost fond Captain Flume since amazing metamorphosis . Captain Flume entered bed night buoyant extrovert left next morning brooding introvert , Chief White Halfoat proudly regarded new Captain Flume creation . He never intended slit Captain Flume ’ throat open ear ear . Threatening merely idea joke , like dying pneumonia , busting Colonel Moodus nose challenging Doc Daneeka Indian wrestle . All Chief White Halfoat wanted staggered drunk night go right sleep , Hungry Joe often made impossible . Hungry Joe ’ nightmares gave Chief White Halfoat heebie-jeebies , often wished someone would tiptoe Hungry Joe ’ tent , lift Huple ’ cat face slit throat open ear ear , everybody squadron Captain Flume could get good night ’ sleep . Even though Chief White Halfoat kept busting Colonel Moodus nose General Dreedle ’ benefit , still outside pale . Also outside pale Major Major , squadron commander , found time found squadron commander Colonel Cathcart , came blasting squadron hopped-up jeep day Major Duluth killed Perugia . Colonel Cathcart slammed screeching stop inches short railroad ditch separating nose jeep lopsided basketball court side , Major Major eventually driven kicks shoves stones punches men almost become friends . “ You ’ new squadron commander , ” Colonel Cathcart bellowed across ditch . “ But ’ think means anything , ’ . All means ’ new squadron commander. ” And Colonel Cathcart roared away abruptly ’ come , whipping jeep around vicious spinning wheels sent spray fine grit blowing Major Major ’ face . Major Major immobilized news . He stood speechless , lanky gawking , scuffed basketball long hands seeds rancor sown swiftly Colonel Cathcart took root soldiers around playing basketball let come close making friends anyone ever let come . The whites moony eyes grew large misty mouth struggled yearningly lost familiar , impregnable loneliness drifting around like suffocating fog . Like officers Group Headquarters except Major Danby , Colonel Cathcart infused democratic spirit : believed men created equal , therefore spurned men outside Group Headquarters equal fervor . Nevertheless , believed men . As told frequently briefing room , believed least ten missions better outfit felt share confidence placed could get hell . The way could get hell , though , Yossarian learned flew visit ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , flying extra ten missions . “ I still ’ get , ” Yossarian protested . “ Is Doc Daneeka right ’ ? ” “ How many say ? ” “ Forty. ” “ Daneeka telling truth , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen admitted . “ Forty missions fly far Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters concerned. ” Yossarian jubilant . “ Then I go home , right ? I ’ got forty-eight. ” “ No , ’ go home , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen corrected . “ Are crazy something ? ” “ Why ? ” “ Catch-22. ” “ Catch-22 ? ” Yossarian stunned . “ What hell Catch-22 got ? ” “ Catch-22 , ” Doc Daneeka answered patiently , Hungry Joe flown Yossarian back Pianosa , “ says ’ always got commanding officer tells to. ” “ But Twenty-seventh Air Force says I go home forty missions. ” “ But ’ say go home . And regulations say obey every order . That ’ catch . Even colonel disobeying Twenty-seventh Air Force order making fly missions , ’ still fly , ’ guilty disobeying order . And Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters would really jump you. ” Yossarian slumped disappointment . “ Then I really fly fifty missions , ’ I ? ” grieved . “ The fifty-five , ” Doc Daneeka corrected . “ What fifty-five ? ” “ The fifty-five missions colonel wants fly. ” Hungry Joe heaved huge sigh relief heard Doc Daneeka broke grin . Yossarian grabbed Hungry Joe neck made fly right back ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . “ What would , ” asked confidential tones , “ I refused fly ? ” “ We ’ probably shoot , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen replied . “ We ? ” Yossarian cried surprise . “ What mean , ? Since side ? ” “ If ’ going shot , whose side expect ? ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen retorted . Yossarian winced . Colonel Cathcart raised . 7 McWATT Ordinarily , Yossarian ’ pilot McWatt , , shaving loud red , clean pajamas outside tent morning , one odd , ironic , incomprehensible things surrounding Yossarian . McWatt craziest combat man probably , perfectly sane still mind war . He short-legged , wide-shouldered , smiling young soul whistled bouncy show tunes continuously turned cards sharp snaps dealt blackjack poker Hungry Joe disintegrated quaking despair finally beneath cumulative impact began ranting stop snapping cards . “ You son bitch , hurts , ” Hungry Joe would yell furiously , Yossarian held back soothingly one hand . “ That ’ reason , likes hear scream-you goddam son bitch ! ” McWatt crinkled fine , freckled nose apologetically vowed snap cards , always forgot . McWatt wore fleecy bedroom slippers red pajamas slept freshly pressed colored bedsheets like one Milo retrieved half grinning thief sweet tooth exchange none pitted dates Milo borrowed Yossarian . McWatt deeply impressed Milo , , amusement Corporal Snark , mess sergeant , already buying eggs seven cents apiece selling five cents . But McWatt never impressed Milo Milo letter Yossarian obtained liver Doc Daneeka . “ What ’ ? ” Milo cried alarm , came upon enormous corrugated carton filled packages dried fruit cans fruit juices desserts two Italian laborers Major -- de Coverley kidnaped kitchen carry Yossarian ’ tent . “ This Captain Yossarian , sir , ” said Corporal Snark superior smirk . Corporal Snark intellectual snob felt twenty years ahead time enjoy cooking masses . “ He letter Doc Daneeka entitling fruit fruit juices wants. ” “ What ’ ? ” cried Yossarian , Milo went white began sway . “ This Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder , sir , ” said Corporal Snark derisive wink . “ One new pilots . He became mess officer hospital last time. ” “ What ’ ? ” cried McWatt , late afternoon , Milo handed half bedsheet . “ It ’ half bedsheet stolen tent morning , ” Milo explained nervous self-satisfaction , rusty mustache twitching rapidly . “ I ’ bet ’ even know stolen. ” “ Why anyone want steal half bedsheet ? ” Yossarian asked . Milo grew flustered . “ You ’ understand , ” protested . And Yossarian also understand Milo needed desperately invest letter Doc Daneeka , came right point . “ Give Yossarian dried fruit fruit juices wants , ” Doc Daneeka written . “ He says liver condition. ” “ A letter like , ” Milo mumbled despondently , “ could ruin mess officer world. ” Milo come Yossarian ’ tent read letter , following carton lost provisions across squadron like mourner . “ I give much ask . Why , letter ’ even say eat yourself. ” “ And ’ good thing ’ , ” Yossarian told , “ I never eat . I liver condition. ” “ Oh , yes , I forgot , ” said Milo , voice lowered deferentially . “ Is bad ? ” “ Just bad enough , ” Yossarian answered cheerfully . “ I see , ” said Milo . “ What mean ? ” “ It means ’ better… ” “ I ’ think I understand. ” “ …without worse . Now see ? ” “ Yes , I see . But I still ’ think I understand. ” “ Well , ’ let trouble . Let trouble . You see , I ’ really liver condition . I ’ got symptoms .

That ’ I never eat fruit. ” “ Now I see , ” said Milo . “ Fruit bad liver ? ” “ No , fruit good liver . That ’ I never eat any. ” “ Then ? ” demanded Milo , plodding along doggedly mounting confusion fling question burning lips . “ Do sell ? ” “ I give away. ” “ To ? ” cried Milo , voice cracking dismay . “ To anyone wants , ” Yossarian shouted back . Milo let long , melancholy wail staggered back , beads perspiration popping suddenly ashen face . He tugged unfortunate mustache absently , whole body trembling . “ I give great deal Dunbar , ” Yossarian went . “ Dunbar ? ” Milo echoed numbly . “ Yes . Dunbar eat fruit wants ’ damned bit good . I leave carton right open anyone wants come help . Aarfy comes get prunes says never gets enough prunes mess hall . You might look ’ got time ’ fun Aarfy hanging around . Whenever supply runs low I Corporal Snark fill . Nately always takes whole load fruit along whenever goes Rome . He ’ love whore hates ’ interested .

Nately brings whole cartonful every time goes. ” “ Does sell ? ” “ No , gives them. ” Milo frowned . “ Well , I suppose ’ generous , ” remarked enthusiasm . “ Yes , generous , ” Yossarian agreed . “ And I ’ sure ’ perfectly legal , ” said Milo , “ since food get . I suppose conditions hard , people glad get it. ” “ Yes , glad , ” Yossarian assured . “ The two girls sell black market use money buy flashy costume jewelry cheap perfume. ” Milo perked . “ Costume jewelry ! ” exclaimed . “ I ’ know . How much paying cheap perfume ? ” “ The old man uses share buy raw whiskey dirty pictures . He ’ lecher. ” “ A lecher ? ” “ You ’ surprised. ” “ Is much market Rome dirty pictures ? ” Milo asked . “ You ’ surprised . Take Aarfy , instance . Knowing , ’ never suspect , would ? ” “ That ’ lecher ? ” “ No , ’ navigator . You know Captain Aardvaark , ’ ? He ’ nice guy came first day squadron said , ‘ Aardvaark ’ name , navigation game. ’ He wore pipe face probably asked college went . Do know ? ” Milo paying attention . “ Let partner , ” blurted imploringly . Yossarian turned , even though doubt truckloads fruit would dispose way saw fit Yossarian requisitioned mess hall Doc Daneeka ’ letter . Milo crestfallen , moment trusted Yossarian every secret one , reasoning shrewdly anyone would steal country loved would steal anybody . Milo trusted Yossarian every secret location holes hills began burying money returned Smyrna planeload figs learned Yossarian C.I.D . man come hospital . To Milo , gullible enough volunteer , position mess officer sacred trust . “ I ’ even realize ’ serving enough prunes , ” admitted first day . “ I suppose ’ I ’ still new . I ’ raise question first chef. ” Yossarian eyed sharply . “ What first chef ? ” demanded . “ You ’ first chef. ” “ Corporal Snark , ” Milo explained , looking away little guiltily . “ He ’ chef I , really first chef , although I hope move administrative side . Corporal Snark tends little creative , I feel . He thinks mess sergeant sort art form always complaining prostitute talents . Nobody asking thing ! Incidentally , happen know busted private corporal ? ” “ Yes , ” said Yossarian . “ He poisoned squadron. ” Milo went pale . “ He ? ” “ He mashed hundreds cakes GI soap sweet potatoes show people taste Philistines ’ know difference good bad . Every man squadron sick . Missions canceled. ” “ Well ! ” Milo exclaimed , thin-upped disapproval . “ He certainly found wrong , ’ ? ” “ On contrary , ” Yossarian corrected . “ He found right .

If mess officer aims anything less , seems , right mess officer . Don ’ agree ? ” Yossarian turned slowly gaze Milo probing distrust . He saw simple , sincere face incapable subtlety guile , honest , frank face disunited large eyes , rusty hair , black eyebrows unfortunate reddish-brown mustache . Milo long , thin nose sniffing , damp nostrils heading sharply right , always pointing away rest looking . It face man hardened integrity could consciously violate moral principles virtue rested could transform despicable toad . One moral principles never sin charge much traffic would bear . He capable mighty paroxysms righteous indignation , indignant could learned C.I.D . man area looking . “ He ’ looking , ” Yossarian said , trying placate . “ He ’ looking someone hospital ’ signing Washington Irving ’ name letters ’ censoring. ” “ I never signed Washington Irving ’ name letters , ” Milo declared . “ Of course not. ” “ But ’ trick get confess I ’ making money black market. ” Milo hauled violently disheveled hunk off-colored mustache . “ I ’ like guys like . Always snooping around people like us . Why ’ government get ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , wants good ? He ’ got respect rules regulations keeps cutting prices me. ” Milo ’ mustache unfortunate separated halves never matched . They like Milo ’ disunited eyes , never looked thing time . Milo could see things people , could see none distinctly . In contrast reaction news C.I.D . man , learned calm courage Yossarian Colonel Cathcart raised number missions fifty-five . “ We ’ war , ” said . “ And ’ use complaining number missions fly . If colonel says fly fifty-five missions , fly them. ” “ Well , I ’ fly , ” Yossarian vowed . “ I ’ go see Major Major. ” “ How ? Major Major never sees anybody. ” “ Then I ’ go back hospital. ” “ You came hospital ten days ago , ” Milo reminded reprovingly . “ You ’ keep running hospital every time something happens ’ like . No , best thing fly missions . It ’ duty. ” Milo rigid scruples would even allow borrow package pitted dates mess hall day McWatt ’ stolen bedsheet , food mess hall still property government . “ But I borrow , ” explained Yossarian , “ since fruit get Doctor Daneeka ’ letter . You whatever want , even sell high profit instead giving away free . Wouldn ’ want together ? ” “ No. ” Milo gave . “ Then lend one package pitted dates , ” requested . “ I ’ give back . I swear I , ’ little something extra you. ” Milo proved good word handed Yossarian quarter McWatt ’ yellow bedsheet returned unopened package dates grinning thief sweet tooth stolen bedsheet McWatt ’ tent . The piece bedsheet belonged Yossarian . He earned napping , although understand . Neither McWatt . “ What ’ ? ” cried McWatt , staring mystification ripped half bedsheet . “ It ’ half bedsheet stolen tent morning , ” Milo explained . “ I ’ bet ’ even know stolen. ” “ Why anyone want steal half bedsheet ? ” Yossarian asked . Milo grew flustered . “ You ’ understand , ” protested . “ He stole whole bedsheet , I got back package pitted dates invested . That ’ quarter bedsheet . You made handsome return investment , particularly since ’ gotten back every pitted date gave me. ” Milo next addressed McWatt . “ Half bedsheet begin , I really ’ understand ’ complaining , since ’ part Captain Yossarian I ’ intervened behalf. ” “ Who ’ complaining ? ” McWatt exclaimed . “ I ’ trying figure I half bedsheet. ” “ There lots things half bedsheet , ” Milo assured . “ The remaining quarter bedsheet I ’ set aside reward enterprise , work initiative .

Don ’ understand ? ” But Yossarian still ’ understand either Milo could buy eggs Malta seven cents apiece sell profit Pianosa five cents . 8 LIEUTENANT SCHEISSKOPF Not even Clevinger understood Milo could , Clevinger knew everything . Clevinger knew everything war except Yossarian die Corporal Snark allowed live , Corporal Snark die Yossarian allowed live . It vile muddy war , Yossarian could lived without it-lived forever , perhaps . Only fraction countrymen would give lives win , ambition among . To die die , question , Clevinger grew limp trying answer . History demand Yossarian ’ premature demise , justice could satisfied without , progress hinge upon , victory depend .

Clevinger mind , Lieutenant Scheisskopf noticed people minds tended get pretty smart times . Such men dangerous , even new cadet officers Clevinger helped office eager give damning testimony . The case Clevinger open shut . The thing missing something charge . It could anything parades , Clevinger took parades almost seriously Lieutenant Scheisskopf . The men fell parades early Sunday afternoon groped way ranks twelve outside barracks . Groaning hangovers , limped step station main paradeground , stood motionless heat hour two men sixty seventy cadet squadrons enough collapsed call day . On edge field stood row ambulances teams trained stretcher bearers walkie-talkies . On roofs ambulances spotters binoculars . A tally clerk kept score . Supervising entire phase operation medical officer flair accounting okayed pulses checked figures tally clerk . As soon enough unconscious men collected ambulances , medical officer signaled bandmaster strike band end parade . One behind , squadrons marched field , executed cumbersome turn around reviewing stand marched field back barracks . Each parading squadrons graded marched past reviewing stand , bloated colonel big fat mustache sat officers . The best squadron wing yellow pennant pole utterly worthless . The best squadron base red pennant longer pole worth even less , since pole heavier much nuisance lug around week squadron following Sunday . To Yossarian , idea pennants prizes absurd . No money went , class privileges . Like Olympic medals tennis trophies , signified owner done something benefit anyone capably everyone else . The parades seemed equally absurd . Yossarian hated parade . Parades martial . He hated hearing , hated seeing , hated tied traffic . He hated made take part . It bad enough aviation cadet without act like soldier blistering heat every Sunday afternoon . It bad enough aviation cadet obvious war would finished training . That reason volunteered cadet training first place . As soldier qualified aviation cadet training , weeks weeks waiting assignment class , weeks weeks become bombardier-navigator , weeks weeks operational training prepare overseas duty . It seemed inconceivable war could last long , God side , told , God , also told , could whatever He wanted . But war nearly , training almost complete . Lieutenant Scheisskopf longed desperately win parades sat half night working wife waited amorously bed thumbing Krafft-Ebing favorite passages . He read books marching . He manipulated boxes chocolate soldiers melted hands maneuvered ranks twelve set plastic cowboys bought mail-order house assumed name kept locked away everyone ’ eyes day . Leonardo ’ exercises anatomy proved indispensable . One evening felt need live model directed wife march around room . “ Naked ? ” asked hopefully . Lieutenant Scheisskopf smacked hands eyes exasperation . It despair Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ life chained woman incapable looking beyond dirty , sexual desires titanic struggles unattainable noble man could become heroically engaged . “ Why ’ ever whip ? ” pouted one night . “ Because I ’ time , ” snapped impatiently . “ I ’ time . Don ’ know ’ parade going ? ” And really time . There Sunday already , seven days left week get ready next parade . He idea hours went . Finishing last three successive parades given Lieutenant Scheisskopf unsavory reputation , considered every means improvement , even nailing twelve men rank long two-by-four beam seasoned oak keep line . The plan feasible , making ninety-degree turn would impossible without nickel-alloy swivels inserted small every man ’ back , Lieutenant Scheisskopf sanguine obtaining many nickel-alloy swivels Quartermaster enlisting cooperation surgeons hospital . The week Lieutenant Scheisskopf followed Clevinger ’ recommendation let men elect cadet officers , squadron yellow pennant . Lieutenant Scheisskopf elated unexpected achievement gave wife sharp crack head pole tried drag bed celebrate showing contempt sexual mores lower middle classes Western civilization . The next week squadron red flag , Lieutenant Scheisskopf beside rapture . And week squadron made history winning red pennant two weeks row ! Now Lieutenant Scheisskopf confidence enough powers spring big surprise . Lieutenant Scheisskopf discovered extensive research hands marchers , instead swinging freely , popular fashion , ought never moved three inches center thigh , meant , effect , scarcely swung . Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ preparations elaborate clandestine . All cadets squadron sworn secrecy rehearsed dead night auxiliary parade-ground . They marched darkness pitch bumped blindly , panic , learning march without swinging hands . Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ first thought friend sheet metal shop sink pegs nickel alloy man ’ thighbones link wrists strands copper wire exactly three inches play , ’ time-there never enough time-and good copper wire hard come wartime . He remembered also men , hampered , would unable fall properly impressive fainting ceremony preceding marching inability faint properly might affect unit ’ rating whole . And week long chortled repressed delight officers ’ club . Speculation grew rampant among closest friends . “ I wonder Shithead , ” Lieutenant Engle said . Lieutenant Scheisskopf responded knowing smile queries colleagues . “ You ’ find Sunday , ” promised . “ You ’ find out. ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf unveiled epochal surprise Sunday aplomb experienced impresario . He said nothing squadrons ambled past reviewing stand crookedly customary manner . He gave sign even first ranks squadron hove sight swingless marching first stricken gasps alarm hissing startled fellow officers . He held back even bloated colonel big fat mustache whirled upon savagely purpling face , offered explanation made immortal . “ Look , Colonel , ” announced . “ No hands. ” And audience stilled awe , distributed certified photostatic copies obscure regulation built unforgettable triumph . This Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ finest hour . He parade , course , hands , obtaining permanent possession red pennant ending Sunday parades altogether , since good red pennants hard come wartime good copper wire . Lieutenant Scheisskopf made First Lieutenant Scheisskopf spot began rapid rise ranks . There hail true military genius important discovery . “ That Lieutenant Scheisskopf , ” Lieutenant Travels remarked . “ He ’ military genius. ” “ Yes , really , ” Lieutenant Engle agreed . “ It ’ pity schmuck ’ whip wife. ” “ I ’ see , ” Lieutenant Travers answered coolly . “ Lieutenant Bemis whips Mrs. Bemis beautifully every time sexual intercourse , ’ worth farthing parades. ” “ I ’ talking flagellation , ” Lieutenant Engle retorted . “ Who gives damn parades ? ” Actually , one Lieutenant Scheisskopf really gave damn parades , least bloated colonel big fat mustache , chairman Action Board began bellowing Clevinger moment Clevinger stepped gingerly room plead innocent charges Lieutenant Scheisskopf lodged . The colonel beat fist upon table hurt hand became enraged Clevinger beat fist upon table even harder hurt hand . Lieutenant Scheisskopf glared Clevinger tight lips , mortified poor impression Clevinger making . “ In sixty days ’ fighting Billy Petrolle , ” colonel big fat mustache roared . “ And think ’ big fat joke. ” “ I ’ think ’ joke , sir , ” Clevinger replied . “ Don ’ interrupt. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And say ‘ sir ’ , ” ordered Major Metcalf . “ Yes , sir. ” “ Weren ’ ordered interrupt ? ” Major Metcalf inquired coldly . “ But I ’ interrupt , sir , ” Clevinger protested . “ No . And ’ say ‘ sir , ’ either . Add charges , ” Major Metcalf directed corporal could take shorthand . “ Failure say ‘ sir ’ superior officers interrupting them. ” “ Metcalf , ” said colonel , “ ’ goddam fool . Do know ? ” Major Metcalf swallowed difficulty . “ Yes , Sir. ” “ Then keep goddam mouth shut . You ’ make sense. ” There three members Action Board , bloated colonel big fat mustache , Lieutenant Scheisskopf Major Metcalf , trying develop steely gaze . As member Action Board , Lieutenant Scheisskopf one judges would weigh merits case Clevinger presented prosecutor . Lieutenant Scheisskopf also prosecutor . Clevinger officer defending . The officer defending Lieutenant Scheisskopf . It confusing Clevinger , began vibrating terror colonel surged feet like gigantic belch threatened rip stinking , cowardly body apart limb limb . One day stumbled marching class ; next day formally charged “ breaking ranks formation , felonious assault , indiscriminate behavior , mopery , high treason , provoking , smart guy , listening classical music ” . In short , threw book , , standing dread bloated colonel , roared sixty days would fighting Billy Petrolle demanded know hell would like washed shipped Solomon Islands bury bodies . Clevinger replied courtesy would like ; dope would rather corpse bury one . The colonel sat settled back , calm cagey suddenly , ingratiatingly polite . “ What mean , ” inquired slowly , “ said ’ punish ? ” “ When , sir ? ” “ I ’ asking questions . You ’ answering them. ” “ Yes , sir . I- “ “ Did think brought ask questions answer ? ” “ No , sir .

I ’ afraid I ’ understand question. ” “ When ’ say ’ punish ? Don ’ understand question ? ” “ No , sir . I ’ understand. ” “ You ’ told us . Now suppose answer question. ” “ But I answer ? ” “ That ’ another question ’ asking me. ” “ I ’ sorry , sir . But I ’ know answer . I never said ’ punish me. ” “ Now ’ telling us say .

Didn ’ whisper ’ punish dirty son bitch ’ like ? What ’ name ? ” “ Yossarian , sir , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf said . “ Yes , Yossarian . That ’ right . Yossarian . Yossarian ? Is name ? Yossarian ?

The way person learn trying. ” “ Who says ? ” “ Everybody says , sir .

Cadet Clevinger , please repeat hell ’ whisper Yossarian late last night latrine ? ” “ Yes , sir . I said ’ find guilty- “ “ We ’ take . Precisely mean , Cadet Clevinger , said ’ find guilty ? ” “ I ’ say ’ find guilty , sir. ” “ When ? ” “ When , sir ? ” “ Goddammit , going start pumping ? ” “ No , sir .

That ’ find- “ “ Justice ? ” The colonel astounded . “ What justice ? ” “ Justice , sir- “ “ That ’ justice , ” colonel jeered , began pounding table big fat hand . “ That ’ Karl Marx .

That ’ justice ’ got tough enough rough enough fight Billy Petrolle . From hip . Get ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ Don ’ sir ! ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And say ‘ sir ’ ’ , ” ordered Major Metcalf . Clevinger guilty , course , would accused , since way prove find guilty , patriotic duty . He sentenced walk fifty-seven punishment tours . Popinjay locked taught lesson , Major Metcalf shipped Solomon Islands bury bodies . A punishment tour Clevinger fifty minutes weekend hour spent pacing back forth provost marshal ’ building ton unloaded rifle shoulder . It confusing Clevinger . There many strange things taking place , strangest , Clevinger , hatred , brutal , uncloaked , inexorable hatred members Action Board , glazing unforgiving expressions hard , vindictive surface , glowing narrowed eyes malignantly like inextinguishable coals . Clevinger stunned discover . They would lynched could . They three grown men boy , hated wished dead . They hated came , hated , hated left , carried hatred away malignantly like pampered treasure separated went solitude . Yossarian done best warn night . “ You ’ got chance , kid , ” told glumly . “ They hate Jews. ” “ But I ’ Jewish , ” answered Clevinger . “ It make difference , ” Yossarian promised , Yossarian right . “ They ’ everybody. ” Clevinger recoiled hatred though blinding light . These three men hated spoke language wore uniform , saw loveless faces set immutably cramped , mean lines hostility understood instantly nowhere world , fascist tanks planes submarines , bunkers behind machine guns mortars behind blowing flame throwers , even among expert gunners crack Hermann Goering Antiaircraft Division among grisly connivers beer halls Munich everywhere else , men hated . 9 MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR Major Major Major Major difficult time start . Like Minniver Cheevy , born late-exactly thirty-six hours late physical well-being mother , gentle , ailing woman , full day half ’ agony rigors childbirth , depleted resolve pursue argument new child ’ name . In hospital corridor , husband moved ahead unsmiling determination someone knew . Major Major ’ father towering , gaunt man heavy shoes black woolen suit . He filled birth certificate without faltering , betraying emotion handed completed form floor nurse . The nurse took without comment padded sight . He watched go , wondering underneath . Back ward , found wife lying vanquished beneath blankets like desiccated old vegetable , wrinkled , dry white , enfeebled tissues absolutely still . Her bed end ward , near cracked window thickened grime . Rain splashed moiling sky day dreary cold . In parts hospital chalky people aged , blue lips dying time . The man stood erect beside bed gazed woman long time . “ I named boy Caleb , ” announced finally soft voice . “ In accordance wishes. ” The woman made answer , slowly man smiled . He planned perfectly , wife asleep would never know lied lay sickbed poor ward county hospital . From meager beginning sprung ineffectual squadron commander spending better part working day Pianosa forging Washington Irving ’ name official documents . Major Major forged diligently left hand elude identification , insulated intrusion undesired authority camouflaged false mustache dark glasses additional safeguard detection anyone chancing peer dowdy celluloid window thief carved slice . In two low points birth success lay thirty-one dismal years loneliness frustration . Major Major born late mediocre . Some men born mediocre , men achieve mediocrity , men mediocrity thrust upon . With Major Major three . Even among men lacking distinction inevitably stood man lacking distinction rest , people met always impressed unimpressive . Major Major three strikes beginning-his mother , father Henry Fonda , bore sickly resemblance almost moment birth . Long even suspected Henry Fonda , found subject unflattering comparisons everywhere went . Total strangers saw fit deprecate , result stricken early guilty fear people obsequious impulse apologize society fact Henry Fonda . It easy task go life looking something like Henry Fonda , never thought quitting , inherited perseverance father , lanky man good sense humor . Major Major ’ father sober God-fearing man whose idea good joke lie age . He long-limbed farmer , God-fearing , freedom-loving , law-abiding rugged individualist held federal aid anyone farmers creeping socialism . He advocated thrift hard work disapproved loose women turned . His specialty alfalfa , made good thing growing . The government paid well every bushel alfalfa grow . The alfalfa grow , money government gave , spent every penny ’ earn new land increase amount alfalfa produce . Major Major ’ father worked without rest growing alfalfa . On long winter evenings remained indoors mend harness , sprang bed crack noon every day make certain chores would done . He invested land wisely soon growing alfalfa man county . Neighbors sought advice subjects , made much money therefore wise . “ As ye sow , shall ye reap , ” counseled one , everyone said , “ Amen. ” Major Major ’ father outspoken champion economy government , provided interfere sacred duty government pay farmers much could get alfalfa produced one else wanted producing alfalfa . He proud independent man opposed unemployment insurance never hesitated whine , whimper , wheedle , extort much could get whomever could . He devout man whose pulpit everywhere . “ The Lord gave us good farmers two strong hands could take much could grab , ” preached ardor courthouse steps front A amp ; P waited bad-tempered gum-chewing young cashier step outside give nasty look . “ If Lord ’ want us take much could get , ” preached , “ He ’ given us two good hands take with. ” And others murmured , “ Amen. ” Major Major ’ father Calvinist ’ faith predestination could perceive distinctly everyone ’ misfortunes expressions God ’ . He smoked cigarettes drank whiskey , thrived good wit stimulating intellectual conversation , particularly lying age telling good one God wife ’ difficulties delivering Major Major . The good one God wife ’ difficulties fact taken God six days produce whole world , whereas wife spent full day half labor produce Major Major . A lesser man might wavered day hospital corridor , weaker man might compromised excellent substitutes Drum Major , Minor Major , Sergeant Major , C. Sharp Major , Major Major ’ father waited fourteen years opportunity , person waste . Major Major ’ father good joke opportunity . “ Opportunity knocks world , ” would say . Major Major ’ father repeated good joke every opportunity . Being born sickly resemblance Henry Fonda first along series practical jokes destiny make Major Major unhappy victim throughout joyless life . Being born Major Major Major second . The fact born Major Major Major secret known father . Not Major Major enrolling kindergarten discovery real name made , effects disastrous . The news killed mother , lost live wasted away died , fine father , decided marry bad-tempered girl A amp ; P optimistic chances getting wife land without paying money flogging . On Major Major consequences slightly less severe . It harsh stunning realization forced upon tender age , realization , always led believe , Caleb Major , instead total stranger named Major Major Major knew absolutely nothing nobody else ever heard . What playmates withdrew never returned , disposed , , distrust strangers , especially one already deceived pretending someone known years . Nobody would anything . He began drop things trip . He shy hopeful manner new contact , always disappointed . Because needed friend desperately , never found one . He grew awkwardly tall , strange , dreamy boy fragile eyes delicate mouth whose tentative , groping smile collapsed instantly hurt disorder every fresh rebuff . He polite elders , disliked . Whatever elders told , . They told look leaped , always looked leaped . They told never put next day could day , never . He told honor father mother , honored father mother . He told kill , kill , got Army . Then told kill , killed . He turned cheek every occasion always unto others exactly would others unto . When gave charity , left hand never knew right hand . He never took name Lord God vain , committed adultery coveted neighbor ’ ass . In fact , loved neighbor never even bore false witness . Major Major ’ elders disliked flagrant nonconformist . Since nothing better well , well school . At state university took studies seriously suspected homosexuals Communist suspected Communists homosexual . He majored English history , mistake . “ English history ! ” roared silver-maned senior Senator state indignantly . “ What ’ matter American history ? American history good history world ! ” Major Major switched immediately American literature , F.B.I . opened file . There six people Scotch terrier inhabiting remote farmhouse Major Major called home , five Scotch terrier turned agents F.B.I . Soon enough derogatory information Major Major whatever wanted . The thing could find , however , take Army private make major four days later Congressmen nothing else minds could go trotting back forth streets Washington , D.C. , chanting , “ Who promoted Major Major ? Who promoted Major Major ? ” Actually , Major Major promoted I.B.M . machine sense humor almost keen father ’ . When war broke , still docile compliant . They told enlist , enlisted . They told apply aviation cadet training , applied aviation cadet training , next night found standing barefoot icy mud three ’ clock morning tough belligerent sergeant Southwest told could beat hell man outfit ready prove . The recruits squadron shaken roughly awake minutes sergeant ’ corporals told assemble front administration tent . It still raining Major Major . They fell ranks civilian clothes brought Army three days . Those lingered put shoes socks sent back cold , wet , dark tents remove , barefoot mud sergeant ran stony eyes faces told could beat hell man outfit . No one inclined dispute . Major Major ’ unexpected promotion major next day plunged belligerent sergeant bottomless gloom , longer able boast could beat hell man outfit . He brooded hours tent like Saul , receiving visitors , elite guard corporals stood discouraged watch outside . At three ’ clock morning found solution , Major Major recruits shaken roughly awake ordered assemble barefoot drizzly glare administration tent , sergeant already waiting , fists clenched hips cockily , eager speak could hardly wait arrive . “ Me Major Major , ” boasted , tough , clipped tones night , “ beat hell man outfit. ” The officers base took action Major Major problem later day . How could cope major like Major Major ? To demean personally would demean officers equal lesser rank . To treat courtesy , hand , unthinkable . Fortunately , Major Major applied aviation cadet training . Orders transferring away sent mimeograph room late afternoon , three ’ clock morning Major Major shaken roughly awake , bidden Godspeed sergeant placed aboard plane heading west . Lieutenant Scheisskopf turned white sheet Major Major reported California bare feet mudcaked toes . Major Major taken granted shaken roughly awake stand barefoot mud left shoes socks tent . The civilian clothing reported duty Lieutenant Scheisskopf rumpled dirty . Lieutenant Scheisskopf , yet made reputation parader , shuddered violently picture Major Major would make marching barefoot squadron coming Sunday . “ Go hospital quickly , ” mumbled , recovered sufficiently speak , “ tell ’ sick . Stay allowance uniforms catches money buy clothes . And shoes . Buy shoes. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ I ’ think call ‘ sir , ’ sir , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf pointed . “ You outrank me. ” “ Yes , sir . I may outrank , sir , ’ still commanding officer. ” “ Yes , sir , ’ right , ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf agreed . “ You may outrank , sir , I ’ still commanding officer . So better I tell , sir , ’ get trouble . Go hospital tell ’ sick , sir . Stay uniform allowance catches money buy uniforms. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And shoes , sir . Buy shoes first chance get , sir. ” “ Yes , sir . I , sir. ” “ Thank , sir. ” Life cadet school Major Major different life along . Whoever always wanted someone else . His instructors gave preferred treatment every stage order push along quickly rid . In almost time pilot ’ wings found overseas , things began suddenly improve . All life , Major Major longed one thing , absorbed , Pianosa , , finally . Rank meant little men combat duty , relations officers enlisted men relaxed informal . Men whose names ’ even know said “ Hi ” invited go swimming play basketball . His ripest hours spent day-long basketball games one gave damn winning . Score never kept , number players might vary one thirty-five . Major Major never played basketball game , great , bobbing height rapturous enthusiasm helped make innate clumsiness lack experience . Major Major found true happiness lopsided basketball court officers enlisted men almost friends . If winners , losers , Major Major enjoyed every gamboling moment right till day Colonel Cathcart roared jeep Major Duluth killed made impossible ever enjoy playing basketball . “ You ’ new squadron commander , ” Colonel Cathcart shouted rudely across railroad ditch . “ But ’ think means anything , ’ . All means ’ new squadron commander. ” Colonel Cathcart nursed implacable grudge Major Major long time . A superfluous major rolls meant untidy table organization gave ammunition men Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters Colonel Cathcart positive enemies rivals . Colonel Cathcart praying stroke good luck like Major Duluth ’ death . He plagued one extra major ; opening one major . He appointed Major Major squadron commander roared away jeep abruptly come . For Major Major , meant end game . His face flushed discomfort , rooted spot disbelief rain clouds gathered . When turned teammates , encountered reef curious , reflective faces gazing woodenly morose inscrutable animosity . He shivered shame . When game resumed , good longer . When dribbled , one tried stop ; called pass , whoever ball passed ; missed basket , one raced rebound . The voice . The next day , day come back . Almost cue , everyone squadron stopped talking started staring . He walked life selfconsciously downcast eyes burning cheeks , object contempt , envy , suspicion , resentment malicious innuendo everywhere went . People hardly noticed resemblance Henry Fonda never ceased discussing , even hinted sinisterly Major Major elevated squadron commander resembled Henry Fonda . Captain Black , aspired position , maintained Major Major really Henry Fonda chickenshit admit . Major Major floundered bewilderedly one embarrassing catastrophe another . Without consulting , Sergeant Towser belongings moved roomy trailer Major Duluth occupied alone , Major Major came rushing breathlessly orderly room report theft things , young corporal scared half wits leaping feet shouting “ Attention ! ” moment appeared . Major Major snapped attention rest orderly room , wondering important personage entered behind . Minutes passed rigid silence , whole lot might stood attention till doomsday Major Danby dropped Group congratulate Major Major twenty minutes later put ease . Major Major fared even lamentably mess hall , Milo , face fluttery smiles , waiting usher proudly small table set front decorated embroidered tablecloth nosegay posies pink cut-glass vase . Major Major hung back horror , bold enough resist others watching . Even Havermeyer lifted head plate gape heavy , pendulous jaw . Major Major submitted meekly Milo ’ tugging cowered disgrace private table throughout whole meal . The food ashes mouth , swallowed every mouthful rather risk offending men connected preparation . Alone Milo later , Major Major felt protest stir first time said would prefer continue eating officers . Milo told ’ work . “ I ’ see work , ” Major Major argued . “ Nothing ever happened before. ” “ You never squadron commander before. ” “ Major Duluth squadron commander always ate table rest men. ” “ It different Major Duluth , Sir. ” “ In way different Major Duluth ? ” “ I wish ’ ask , sir , ” said Milo . “ Is I look like Henry Fonda ? ” Major Major mustered courage demand . “ Some people say Henry Fonda , ” Milo answered . “ Well , I ’ Henry Fonda , ” Major Major exclaimed , voice quavering exasperation . “ And I ’ look least bit like . And even I look like Henry Fonda , difference make ? ” “ It ’ make difference . That ’ I ’ trying tell , sir . It ’ Major Duluth. ” And ’ , Major Major , next meal , stepped food counter sit others regular tables , frozen tracks impenetrable wall antagonism thrown faces stood petrified tray quivering hands Milo glided forward wordlessly rescue , leading tamely private table . Major Major gave always ate table alone back others . He certain resented seemed good eat squadron commander . There never conversation mess tent Major Major present . He conscious officers tried avoid eating time , everyone greatly relieved stopped coming altogether began taking meals trailer . Major Major began forging Washington Irving ’ name official documents day first C.I.D . man showed interrogate somebody hospital gave idea . He bored dissatisfied new position . He made squadron commander idea supposed squadron commander , unless supposed forge Washington Irving ’ name official documents listen isolated clinks thumps Major -- de Coverley ’ horseshoes falling ground outside window small office rear orderly-room tent . He hounded incessantly impression vital duties left unfulfilled waited vain responsibilities overtake . He seldom went unless absolutely necessary , could get used stared . Occasionally , monotony broken officer enlisted man Sergeant Towser referred matter Major Major unable cope referred right back Sergeant Towser sensible disposition . Whatever supposed get done squadron commander apparently getting done without assistance . He grew moody depressed . At times thought seriously going sorrows see chaplain , chaplain seemed overburdened miseries Major Major shrank adding troubles . Besides , quite sure chaplains squadron commanders . He never quite sure Major -- de Coverley , either , , away renting apartments kidnaping foreign laborers , nothing pressing pitch horseshoes . Major Major often paid strict attention horseshoes falling softly earth riding around small steel pegs ground . He peeked Major -- de Coverley hours marveled someone august nothing important . He often tempted join Major -- de Coverley , pitching horseshoes day long seemed almost dull signing “ Major Major Major ” official documents , Major -- de Coverley ’ countenance forbidding Major Major awe approaching . Major Major wondered relationship Major -- de Coverley Major -- de Coverley ’ relationship . He knew Major -- de Coverley executive officer , know meant , could decide whether Major -- de Coverley blessed lenient superior cursed delinquent subordinate . He want ask Sergeant Towser , secretly afraid , one else could ask , least Major -- de Coverley . Few people ever dared approach Major -- de Coverley anything officer foolish enough pitch one horseshoes stricken next day worst case Pianosan crud Gus Wes even Doc Daneeka ever seen even heard . Everyone positive disease inflicted upon poor officer retribution Major -- de Coverley , although one sure . Most official documents came Major Major ’ desk concern . The vast majority consisted allusions prior communications Major Major never seen heard . There never need look , instructions invariably disregard . In space single productive minute , therefore , might endorse twenty separate documents advising pay absolutely attention others . From General Peckem ’ office mainland came prolix bulletins day headed cheery homilies “ Procrastination Thief Time ” “ Cleanliness Next Godliness. ” General Peckem ’ communications cleanliness procrastination made Major Major feel like filthy procrastinator , always got way quickly could . The official documents interested occasional ones pertaining unfortunate second lieutenant killed mission Orvieto less two hours arrived Pianosa whose partly unpacked belongings still Yossarian ’ tent . Since unfortunate lieutenant reported operations tent instead orderly room , Sergeant Towser decided would safest report never reported squadron , occasional documents relating dealt fact seemed vanished thin air , , one way , exactly happen . In long run , Major Major grateful official documents came desk , sitting office signing day long lot better sitting office day long signing . They gave something . Inevitably , every document signed came back fresh page added new signature intervals two ten days . They always much thicker formerly , sheet bearing last endorsement sheet added new endorsement sheets bearing recent endorsements officers scattered locations also occupied signing names official document . Major Major grew despondent watched simple communications swell prodigiously huge manuscripts . No matter many times signed one , always came back still another signature , began despair ever free . One day-it day C.I.D . man ’ first visit-Major Major signed Washington Irving ’ name one documents instead , see would feel . He liked . He liked much rest afternoon official documents . It act impulsive frivolity rebellion knew afterward would punished severely . The next morning entered office trepidation waited see would happen . Nothing happened . He sinned , good , none documents signed Washington Irving ’ name ever came back ! Here , last , progress , Major Major threw new career uninhibited gusto . Signing Washington Irving ’ name official documents much career , perhaps , less monotonous signing “ Major Major Major. ” When Washington Irving grow monotonous , could reverse order sign Irving Washington grew monotonous . And getting something done , none documents signed either names ever came back squadron . What come back , eventually , second C.I.D . man , masquerading pilot . The men knew C.I.D . man confided urged reveal true identity men already confided C.I.D . man . “ You ’ one squadron knows I ’ C.I.D . man , ” confided Major Major , “ ’ absolutely essential remain secret efficiency ’ impaired . Do understand ? ” “ Sergeant Towser knows. ” “ Yes , I know . I tell order get see . But I know ’ tell soul circumstances. ” “ He told , ” said Major Major . “ He told C.I.D . man outside see me. ” “ That bastard . I ’ throw security check . I ’ leave top-secret documents lying around I . At least I make report. ” “ I ’ get top-secret documents , ” said Major Major . “ That ’ kind I mean . Lock cabinet Sergeant Towser ’ get hands them. ” “ Sergeant Towser key cabinet. ” “ I ’ afraid ’ wasting time , ” said second C.I.D . man rather stiffly . He brisk , pudgy , high-strung person whose movements swift certain . He took number photostats large red expansion envelope hiding conspicuously beneath leather flight jacket painted garishly pictures airplanes flying orange bursts flak orderly rows little bombs signifying fifty-five combat missions flown . “ Have ever seen ? ” Major Major looked blank expression copies personal correspondence hospital censoring officer written “ Washington Irving ” “ Irving Washington. ” No . “ How ? ” Major Major gazed next copies official documents addressed signing signatures . “ No. ” “ Is man signed names squadron ? ” “ Which one ? There two names here. ” “ Either one . We figure Washington Irving Irving Washington one man ’ using two names throw us track . That ’ done often know. ” “ I ’ think ’ man either names squadron. ” A look disappointment crossed second C.I.D . man ’ face . “ He ’ lot cleverer thought , ” observed . “ He ’ using third name posing someone else . And I think… yes , I think I know third name is. ” With excitement inspiration , held another photostat Major Major study . “ How ? ” Major Major bent forward slightly saw copy piece V mail Yossarian blacked everything name Mary written , “ I yearn tragically . R. O. Shipman , Chaplain , U.S. Army. ” Major Major shook head . “ I ’ never seen before. ” “ Do know R. O. Shipman ? ” “ He ’ group chaplain. ” “ That locks , ” said second C.I.D . man . “ Washington Irving group chaplain. ” Major Major felt twinge alarm . “ R . O. Shipman group chaplain , ” corrected . “ Are sure ? ” “ Yes. ” “ Why group chaplain write letter ? ” “ Perhaps somebody else wrote forged name. ” “ Why somebody want forge group chaplain ’ name ? ” “ To escape detection. ” “ You may right , ” second C.I.D . man decided instant ’ hesitation , smacked lips crisply . “ Maybe ’ confronted gang , two men working together happen opposite names . Yes , I ’ sure ’ . One squadron , one hospital one chaplain . That makes three men , ’ ? Are absolutely sure never saw official documents ? ” “ I would signed I had. ” “ With whose name ? ” asked second C.I.D . man cunningly . “ Yours Washington Irving ’ ? ” “ With name , ” Major Major told . “ I ’ even know Washington Irving ’ name. ” The second C.I.D . man broke smile . “ Major , I ’ glad ’ clear . It means ’ able work together , I ’ going need every man I get . Somewhere European theater operations man ’ getting hands communications addressed . Have idea ? ” “ No. ” “ Well , I pretty good idea , ” said second C.I.D . man , leaned forward whisper confidentially . “ That bastard Towser . Why else would go around shooting mouth ? Now , keep eyes open let know minute hear anyone even talking Washington Irving . I ’ throw security check chaplain everyone else around here. ” The moment gone , first C.I.D . man jumped Major Major ’ office window wanted know second C.I.D . man . Major Major barely recognized . “ He C.I.D . man , ” Major Major told . “ Like hell , ” said first C.I.D . man . “ I ’ C.I.D . man around here. ” Major Major barely recognized wearing faded maroon corduroy bathrobe open seams arms , linty flannel pajamas , worn house slippers one flapping sole . This regulation hospital dress , Major Major recalled . The man added twenty pounds seemed bursting good health . “ I ’ really sick man , ” whined . “ I caught cold hospital fighter pilot came serious case pneumonia. ” “ I ’ sorry , ” Major Major said . “ A lot good , ” C.I.D . man sniveled . “ I ’ want sympathy . I want know I ’ going . I came warn Washington Irving seems shifted base operations hospital squadron . You ’ heard anyone around talking Washington Irving , ? ” “ As matter fact , I , ” Major Major answered . “ That man . He talking Washington Irving. ” “ Was really ? ” first C.I.D . man cried delight . “ This might needed crack case wide open ! You keep surveillance twenty-four hours day I rush back hospital write superiors instructions. ” The C.I.D . man jumped Major Major ’ office window gone . A minute later , flap separating Major Major ’ office orderly room flew open second C.I.D . man back , puffing frantically haste . Gasping breath , shouted , “ I saw man red pajamas jumping window go running road ! Didn ’ see ? ” “ He talking , ” Major Major answered . “ I thought looked mighty suspicious , man jumping window red pajamas. ” The man paced small office vigorous circles . “ At first I thought , hightailing Mexico . But I see ’ . He ’ say anything Washington Irving , ? ” “ As matter fact , ” said Major Major , “ did. ” “ He ? ” cried second C.I.D . man . “ That ’ fine ! This might break needed crack case wide open . Do know find ? ” “ At hospital . He ’ really sick man. ” “ That ’ great ! ” exclaimed second C.I.D . man . “ I ’ go right . It would best I went incognito . I ’ go explain situation medical tent send patient. ” “ They ’ send hospital patient unless I ’ sick , ” reported back Major Major . “ Actually , I pretty sick . I ’ meaning turn checkup , good opportunity . I ’ go back medical tent tell I ’ sick , I ’ get sent hospital way. ” “ Look , ” reported back Major Major purple gums . His distress inconsolable . He carried shoes socks hands , toes painted gentian-violet solution , . “ Who ever heard C.I.D . man purple gums ? ” moaned . He walked away orderly room head tumbled slit trench broke nose . His temperature still normal , Gus Wes made exception sent hospital ambulance . Major Major lied , good . He really surprised good , observed people lie , whole , resourceful ambitious successful people lie . Had told truth second C.I.D . man , would found trouble . Instead lied free continue work . He became circumspect work result visit second C.I.D . man . He signing left hand wearing dark glasses false mustache used unsuccessfully help begin playing basketball . As additional precaution , made happy switch Washington Irving John Milton . John Milton supple concise . Like Washington Irving , could reversed good effect whenever grew monotonous . Furthermore , enabled Major Major double output , John Milton much shorter either name Washington Irving ’ took much less time write . John Milton proved fruitful still one respect . He versatile , Major Major soon found incorporating signature fragments imaginary dialogues . Thus , typical endorsements official documents might read , “ John Milton sadist ” “ Have seen Milton , John ? ” One signature especially proud read , “ Is anybody John , Milton ? ” John Milton threw open whole new vistas filled charming , inexhaustible possibilities promised ward monotony forever . Major Major went back Washington Irving John Milton grew monotonous . Major Major bought dark glasses false mustache Rome final , futile attempt save swampy degradation steadily sinking . First awful humiliation Great Loyalty Oath Crusade , one thirty forty people circulating competitive loyalty oaths would even allow sign . Then , blowing , matter Clevinger ’ plane disappearing mysteriously thin air every member crew , blame strange mishap centering balefully never signed loyalty oaths . The dark glasses large magenta rims . The false black mustache flamboyant organ-grinder ’ , wore basketball game one day felt could endure loneliness longer . He affected air jaunty familiarity sauntered court prayed silently would recognized . The others pretended recognize , began fun . Just finished congratulating innocent ruse bumped hard one opponents knocked knees . Soon bumped hard , dawned recognize using disguise license elbow , trip maul . They want . And realize , players team fused instinctively players team single , howling , bloodthirsty mob descended upon sides foul curses swinging fists . They knocked ground , kicked ground , attacked struggled blindly feet . He covered face hands could see . They swarmed frenzied compulsion bludgeon , kick , gouge , trample . He pummeled spinning edge ditch sent slithering head shoulders . At bottom found footing , clambered wall staggered away beneath hail hoots stones pelted lurched shelter around corner orderly room tent . His paramount concern throughout entire assault keep dark glasses false mustache place might continue pretending somebody else spared dreaded necessity confront authority . Back office , wept ; finished weeping washed blood mouth nose , scrubbed dirt abrasions cheek forehead , summoned Sergeant Towser . “ From , ” said , “ I ’ want anyone come see I ’ . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said Sergeant Towser . “ Does include ? ” “ Yes. ” “ I see . Will ? ” “ Yes. ” “ What shall I say people come see ’ ? ” “ Tell I ’ ask wait. ” “ Yes , sir . For long ? ” “ Until I ’ left. ” “ And shall I ? ” “ I ’ care. ” “ May I send see ’ left ? ” “ Yes. ” “ But ’ , ? ” “ No. ” “ Yes , sir .

Don ’ come anything unless ’ sure I ’ here. ” “ Yes , sir . But I always sure ? ” “ If ’ sure , assume I go away sure . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ I ’ sorry talk way , I . Goodbye. ” “ Goodbye , sir. ” “ And thank . For everything. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ From , ” Major Major said Milo Minderbinder , “ I ’ going come mess hall . I ’ meals brought trailer. ” “ I think ’ good idea , sir , ” Milo answered . “ Now I ’ able serve special dishes others never know . I ’ sure ’ enjoy . Colonel Cathcart always does. ” “ I ’ want special dishes . I want exactly serve officers . Just whoever brings knock door leave tray step . Is clear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said Milo . “ That ’ clear . I ’ got live Maine lobsters hidden away I serve tonight excellent Roquefort salad two frozen éclairs smuggled Paris yesterday together important member French underground . Will start ? ” “ No. ” “ Yes , sir . I understand. ” For dinner night Milo served broiled Maine lobster excellent Roquefort salad two frozen éclairs . Major Major annoyed . If sent back , though , would go waste somebody else , Major Major weakness broiled lobster . He ate guilty conscience . The next day lunch terrapin Maryland whole quart Dom Pérignon 1937 , Major Major gulped without thought . After Milo , remained men orderly room , Major Major avoided entering leaving every time dingy celluloid window office . The window unbuttoned low large easy jump either side . He managed distance orderly room trailer darting around corner tent coast clear , leaping railroad ditch dashing along head bowed attained sanctuary forest . Abreast trailer , left ditch wove way speedily toward home dense underbrush , person ever encountered Captain Flume , , drawn ghostly , frightened half death one twilight materializing without warning patch dewberry bushes complain Chief White Halfoat threatened slit throat open ear ear . “ If ever frighten like , ” Major Major told , “ I ’ slit throat open ear ear. ” Captain Flume gasped dissolved right back patch dewberry bushes , Major Major never set eyes . When Major Major looked back accomplished , pleased . In midst foreign acres teeming two hundred people , succeeded becoming recluse . With little ingenuity vision , made impossible anyone squadron talk , fine everyone , noticed , since one wanted talk anyway . No one , turned , madman Yossarian , brought flying tackle one day scooting along bottom ditch trailer lunch . The last person squadron Major Major wanted brought flying tackle Yossarian . There something inherently disreputable Yossarian , always carrying disgracefully dead man tent ’ even taking clothes Avignon mission going around without right day General Dreedle stepped pin medal heroism Ferrara found standing formation stark naked . No one world power remove dead man ’ disorganized effects Yossarian ’ tent . Major Major forfeited authority permitted Sergeant Towser report lieutenant killed Orvieto less two hours arrived squadron never arrived squadron . The one right remove belongings Yossarian ’ tent , seemed Major Major , Yossarian , Yossarian , seemed Major Major , right . Major Major groaned Yossarian brought flying tackle , tried wiggle feet . Yossarian ’ let . “ Captain Yossarian , ” Yossarian said , “ requests permission speak major matter life death. ” “ Let , please , ” Major Major bid cranky discomfort . “ I ’ return salute I ’ lying arm. ” Yossarian released . They stood slowly . Yossarian saluted repeated request . “ Let ’ go office , ” Major Major said . “ I ’ think best place talk. ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered Yossarian . They smacked gravel clothing walked constrained silence entrance orderly room . “ Give minute two put mercurochrome cuts . Then Sergeant Towser send in. ” “ Yes , sir. ” Major Major strode dignity rear orderly room without glancing clerks typists working desks filing cabinets . He let flap leading office fall closed behind . As soon alone office , raced across room window jumped outside dash away . He found Yossarian blocking path . Yossarian waiting attention saluted . “ Captain Yossarian requests permission speak major matter life death , ” repeated determinedly . “ Permission denied , ” Major Major snapped . “ That ’ it. ” Major Major gave . “ All right , ” conceded wearily . “ I ’ talk . Please jump inside office. ” “ After you. ” They jumped inside office . Major Major sat , Yossarian moved around front desk told want fly combat missions . What could ? Major Major asked . All could instructed Colonel Korn hope best . “ Why ? ” asked . “ I ’ afraid. ” “ That ’ nothing ashamed , ” Major Major counseled kindly . “ We ’ afraid. ” “ I ’ ashamed , ” Yossarian said . “ I ’ afraid. ” “ You ’ normal never afraid . Even bravest men experience fear . One biggest jobs face combat overcome fear. ” “ Oh , come , Major . Can ’ without horseshit ? ” Major Major lowered gaze sheepishly fiddled fingers . “ What want tell ? ” “ That I ’ flown enough missions go home. ” “ How many flown ? ” “ Fifty-one. ” “ You ’ got four fly. ” “ He ’ raise . Every time I get close raises them. ” “ Perhaps ’ time. ” “ He never sends anyone home , anyway . He keeps around waiting rotation orders ’ enough men left crews , raises number missions throws back combat status . He ’ ever since got here. ” “ You ’ blame Colonel Cathcart delay orders , ” Major Major advised . “ It ’ Twenty-seventh Air Force ’ responsibility process orders promptly get us. ” “ He could still ask replacements send us home orders come back . Anyway , I ’ told Twenty-seventh Air Force wants forty missions ’ idea get us fly fifty-five. ” “ I ’ know anything , ” Major Major answered . “ Colonel Cathcart commanding officer must obey . Why ’ fly four missions see happens ? ” “ I ’ want to. ” What could ? Major Major asked . What could man looked squarely eye said would rather die killed combat , man least mature intelligent pretend ? What could say ? “ Suppose let pick missions fly milk runs , ” Major Major said . “ That way fly four missions run risks. ” “ I ’ want fly milk runs . I ’ want war more. ” “ Would like see country lose ? ” Major Major asked . “ We ’ lose . We ’ got men , money material . There ten million men uniform could replace . Some people getting killed lot making money fun . Let somebody else get killed. ” “ But suppose everybody side felt way. ” “ Then I ’ certainly damned fool feel way . Wouldn ’ I ? ” What could possibly say ? Major Major wondered forlornly . One thing could say nothing could . To say nothing could would suggest would something could imply existence error injustice Colonel Korn ’ policy . Colonel Korn explicit . He must never say nothing could . “ I ’ sorry , ” said . “ But ’ nothing I do. ” 10 WINTERGREEN Clevinger dead . That basic flaw philosophy . Eighteen planes let beaming white cloud coast Elba one afternoon way back weekly milk run Parma ; seventeen came . No trace ever found , air smooth surface jade waters . There debris . Helicopters circled white cloud till sunset . During night cloud blew away , morning Clevinger . The disappearance astounding , astounding , certainly , Grand Conspiracy Lowery Field , sixty-four men single barrack vanished one payday never heard . Until Clevinger snatched existence adroitly , Yossarian assumed men simply decided unanimously go AWOL day . In fact , encouraged appeared mass desertion sacred responsibility gone running outside elation carry exciting news ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . “ What ’ exciting ? ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen sneered obnoxiously , resting filthy GI shoe spade lounging back surly slouch wall one deep , square holes military specialty dig . Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen snide little punk enjoyed working cross-purposes . Each time went AWOL , caught sentenced dig fill holes six feet deep , wide long specified length time . Each time finished sentence , went AWOL . Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen accepted role digging filling holes uncomplaining dedication true patriot . “ It ’ bad life , ” would observe philosophically . “ And I guess somebody it. ” He wisdom enough understand digging holes Colorado bad assignment wartime . Since holes great demand , could dig fill leisurely pace , seldom overworked . On hand , busted buck private time court-martialed . He regretted loss rank keenly . “ It kind nice P.F.C. , ” reminisced yearningly . “ I status-you know I mean ? – I used travel best circles. ” His face darkened resignation . “ But ’ behind , ” guessed . “ The next time I go hill buck private , I know ’ same. ” There future digging holes . “ The job ’ even steady . I lose time I finish serving sentence . Then I go hill I want back . And I ’ even keep . There ’ catch . Catch-22 . The next time I go hill , mean stockade . I ’ know ’ going become . I might even wind overseas I ’ careful. ” He want keep digging holes rest life , although objection long war going part war effort . “ It ’ matter duty , ” observed , “ perform . My duty keep digging holes , I ’ good job I ’ recommended Good Conduct Medal . Your duty screw around cadet school hope war ends get . The duty men combat win war , I wish duty well I ’ mine . It ’ fair I go overseas job , would ? ” One day ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen struck open water pipe digging one holes almost drowned death fished nearly unconscious . Word spread oil , Chief White Halfoat kicked base . Soon every man could find shovel outside digging frenziedly oil . Dirt flew everywhere ; scene almost like morning Pianosa seven months later night Milo bombed squadron every plane accumulated M amp ; M syndicate , airfield , bomb dump repair hangars well , survivors outside hacking cavernous shelters solid ground roofing sheets armor plate stolen repair sheds field tattered squares waterproof canvas stolen side flaps ’ tents . Chief White Halfoat transferred Colorado first rumor oil came rest finally Pianosa replacement Lieutenant Coombs , gone mission guest one day see combat like died Ferrara plane Kraft . Yossarian felt guilty time remembered Kraft , guilty Kraft killed Yossarian ’ second bomb run , guilty Kraft got mixed innocently also Splendid Atabrine Insurrection begun Puerto Rico first leg flight overseas ended Pianosa ten days later Appleby striding dutifully orderly room moment arrived report Yossarian refusing take Atabrine tablets . The sergeant invited seated . “ Thank , Sergeant , I think I , ” said Appleby . “ About long I wait ? I ’ still got lot get done today I fully prepared bright early tomorrow morning go combat minute want to. ” “ Sir ? ” “ What ’ , Sergeant ? ” “ What question ? ” “ About long I wait I go see major ? ” “ Just goes lunch , ” Sergeant Towser replied . “ Then go right in. ” “ But ’ . Will ? ” “ No , sir . Major Major ’ back office lunch. ” “ I see , ” Appleby decided uncertainly . “ I think I ’ better come back lunch , then. ” Appleby turned orderly room secret confusion . The moment stepped outside , thought saw tall , dark officer looked little like Henry Fonda come jumping window orderly-room tent go scooting sight around corner . Appleby halted squeezed eyes closed . An anxious doubt assailed . He wondered suffering malaria , , worse , overdose Atabrine tablets . Appleby taking four times many Atabrine tablets amount prescribed wanted four times good pilot everyone else . His eyes still shut Sergeant Towser tapped lightly shoulder told could go wanted , since Major Major gone . Appleby ’ confidence returned . “ Thank , Sergeant . Will back soon ? ” “ He ’ back right lunch . Then ’ go right wait front till leaves dinner . Major Major never sees anyone office ’ office. ” “ Sergeant , say ? ” “ I said Major Major never sees anyone office ’ office. ” Appleby stared Sergeant Towser intently attempted firm tone . “ Sergeant , trying make fool I ’ new squadron ’ overseas long time ? ” “ Oh , , sir , ” answered sergeant deferentially . “ Those orders . You ask Major Major see him. ” “ That ’ I intend , Sergeant . When I see ? ” “ Never. ” Crimson humiliation , Appleby wrote report Yossarian Atabrine tablets pad sergeant offered left quickly , wondering perhaps Yossarian man privileged wear officer ’ uniform crazy . By time Colonel Cathcart raised number missions fifty-five , Sergeant Towser begun suspect perhaps every man wore uniform crazy . Sergeant Towser lean angular fine blond hair light almost without color , sunken cheeks , teeth like large white marshmallows . He ran squadron happy . Men like Hungry Joe glowered blameful hatred , Appleby subjected vindictive discourtesy established hot pilot ping-pong player never lost point . Sergeant Towser ran squadron one else squadron run . He interest war advancement . He interested shards Hepplewhite furniture . Almost without realizing , Sergeant Towser fallen habit thinking dead man Yossarian ’ tent Yossarian ’ terms-as dead man Yossarian ’ tent . In reality , thing . He simply replacement pilot killed combat officially reported duty . He stopped operations tent inquire way orderly-room tent sent right action many men completed thirty-five missions required Captain Piltchard Captain Wren finding difficult assemble number crews specified Group . Because never officially gotten squadron , could never officially gotten , Sergeant Towser sensed multiplying communications relating poor man would continue reverberating forever . His name Mudd . To Sergeant Towser , deplored violence waste equal aversion , seemed like abhorrent extravagance fly Mudd way across ocean blown bits Orvieto less two hours arrived . No one could recall looked like , least Captain Piltchard Captain Wren , remembered new officer shown operations tent time killed colored uneasily every time matter dead man Yossarian ’ tent mentioned . The one might seen Mudd , men plane , blown bits . Yossarian , hand , knew exactly Mudd . Mudd unknown soldier never chance , thing anyone ever know unknown soldiers-they never chance . They dead . And dead one really unknown , even though belongings still lay tumble cot Yossarian ’ tent almost exactly left three months earlier day never arrived-all contaminated death less two hours later , way contaminated death next week Great Big Siege Bologna moldy odor mortality hung wet air sulphurous fog every man scheduled fly already tainted . There escaping mission Bologna Colonel Cathcart volunteered group ammunition dumps heavy bombers Italian mainland unable destroy higher altitudes . Each day ’ delay deepened awareness deepened gloom . The clinging , overpowering conviction death spread steadily continuing rainfall , soaking mordantly man ’ ailing countenance like corrosive blot crawling disease . Everyone smelled formaldehyde . There nowhere turn help , even medical tent , ordered closed Colonel Korn one could report sick call , men done one clear day mysterious epidemic diarrhea forced still another postponement . With sick call suspended door medical tent nailed shut , Doc Daneeka spent intervals rain perched high stool , wordlessly absorbing bleak outbreak fear sorrowing neutrality , roosting like melancholy buzzard ominous , hand-lettered sign tacked closed door medical tent Captain Black joke left hanging Doc Daneeka joke . The sign bordered dark crayon read : “ CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE . DEATH IN THE FAMILY. ” The fear flowed everywhere , Dunbar ’ squadron , Dunbar poked head inquiringly entrance medical tent one twilight spoke respectfully blurred outline Dr. Stubbs , sitting dense shadows inside bottle whiskey bell jar filled purified drinking water . “ Are right ? ” asked solicitously . “ Terrible , ” Dr. Stubbs answered . “ What ? ” “ Sitting. ” “ I thought sick call. ” “ There ’ t. ” “ Then sitting ? ” “ Where else I sit ? At goddam officers ’ club Colonel Cathcart Korn ? Do know I ’ ? ” “ Sitting. ” “ In squadron , I mean . Not tent . Don ’ goddam wise guy . Can figure doctor squadron ? ” “ They ’ got doors medical tents nailed shut squadrons , ” Dunbar remarked . “ If anyone sick walks door I ’ going ground , ” Dr. Stubbs vowed . “ I ’ give damn say. ” “ You ’ ground anyone , ” Dunbar reminded . “ Don ’ know orders ? ” “ I ’ knock flat ass injection really ground him. ” Dr. Stubbs laughed sardonic amusement prospect . “ They think order sick call existence . The bastards . Ooops , goes again. ” The rain began falling , first trees , mud puddles , , faintly , like soothing murmur , tent top . “ Everything ’ wet , ” Dr. Stubbs observed revulsion . “ Even latrines urinals backing protest . The whole goddam world smells like charnel house. ” The silence seemed bottomless stopped talking . Night fell . There sense vast isolation . “ Turn light , ” Dunbar suggested . “ There light . I ’ feel like starting generator . I used get big kick saving people ’ lives . Now I wonder hell ’ point , since die anyway . “ Oh , ’ point , right , ” Dunbar assured . “ Is ? What point ? ” “ The point keep dying long can. ” “ Yeah , ’ point , since die anyway ? ” “ The trick think that. ” “ Never mind trick . What hell ’ point ? ” Dunbar pondered silence moments . “ Who hell knows ? ” Dunbar ’ know . Bologna exulted Dunbar , minutes dawdled hours dragged like centuries . Instead tortured , knew going killed . “ Do really want codeine ? ” Dr. Stubbs asked . “ It ’ friend Yossarian . He ’ sure ’ going killed. ” “ Yossarian ? Who hell Yossarian ? What hell kind name Yossarian , anyway ? Isn ’ one got drunk started fight Colonel Korn officers ’ club night ? ” “ That ’ right . He ’ Assyrian. ” “ That crazy bastard. ” “ He ’ crazy , ” Dunbar said . “ He swears ’ going fly Bologna. ” “ That ’ I mean , ” Dr. Stubbs answered . “ That crazy bastard may sane one left. ” 11 CAPTAIN BLACK Corporal Kolodny learned first phone call Group shaken news crossed intelligence tent tiptoe Captain Black , resting drowsily bladed shins desk , relayed information shocked whisper . Captain Black brightened immediately . “ Bologna ? ” exclaimed delight . “ Well , I ’ damned. ” He broke loud laughter . “ Bologna , huh ? ” He laughed shook head pleasant amazement . “ Oh , boy ! I ’ wait see bastards ’ faces find ’ going Bologna . Ha , ha , ha ! ” It first really good laugh Captain Black enjoyed since day Major Major outsmarted appointed squadron commander , rose torpid enthusiasm stationed behind front counter order wring enjoyment occasion bombardiers arrived map kits . “ That ’ right , bastards , Bologna , ” kept repeating bombardiers inquired incredulously really going Bologna . “ Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Eat livers , bastards . This time ’ really it. ” Captain Black followed last outside observe relish effect knowledge upon officers enlisted men assembling helmets , parachutes flak suits around four trucks idling center squadron area . He tall , narrow , disconsolate man moved crabby listlessness . He shaved pinched , pale face every third fourth day , time appeared growing reddish-gold mustache skinny upper lip . He disappointed scene outside . There consternation darkening every expression , Captain Black yawned deliciously , rubbed last lethargy eyes laughed gloatingly time told someone else eat liver . Bologna turned rewarding event Captain Black ’ life since day Major Duluth killed Perugia almost selected replace . When word Major Duluth ’ death radioed back field , Captain Black responded surge joy . Although never really contemplated possibility , Captain Black understood logical man succeed Major Duluth squadron commander . To begin , squadron intelligence officer , meant intelligent everyone else squadron . True , combat status , Major Duluth squadron commanders customarily ; really another powerful argument favor , since life danger would able fill post long country needed . The Captain Black thought , inevitable seemed . It merely matter dropping right word right place quickly . He hurried back office determine course action . Settling back swivel chair , feet desk eyes closed , began imagining beautiful everything would squadron commander . While Captain Black imagining , Colonel Cathcart acting , Captain Black flabbergasted speed , concluded , Major Major outsmarted . His great dismay announcement Major Major ’ appointment squadron commander tinged embittered resentment made effort conceal . When fellow administrative officers expressed astonishment Colonel Cathcart ’ choice Major Major , Captain Black muttered something funny going ; speculated political value Major Major ’ resemblance Henry Fonda , Captain Black asserted Major Major really Henry Fonda ; remarked Major Major somewhat odd , Captain Black announced Communist . “ They ’ taking everything , ” declared rebelliously . “ Well , fellows stand around let want , I ’ going . I ’ going something . From I ’ going make every son bitch comes intelligence tent sign loyalty oath . And I ’ going let bastard Major Major sign one even wants to. ” Almost overnight Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade full flower , Captain Black enraptured discover spearheading . He really hit something . All enlisted men officers combat duty sign loyalty oath get map cases intelligence tent , second loyalty oath receive flak suits parachutes parachute tent , third loyalty oath Lieutenant Balkington , motor vehicle officer , allowed ride squadron airfield one trucks . Every time turned around another loyalty oath signed . They signed loyalty oath get pay finance officer , obtain PX supplies , hair cut Italian barbers . To Captain Black , every officer supported Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade competitor , planned plotted twenty-four hours day keep one step ahead . He would stand second none devotion country . When officers followed urging introduced loyalty oaths , went one better making every son bitch came intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths , three , four ; introduced pledge allegiance , “ The Star-Spangled Banner , ” one chorus , two choruses , three choruses , four choruses . Each time Captain Black forged ahead competitors , swung upon scornfully failure follow example . Each time followed example , retreated concern racked brain new stratagem would enable turn upon scornfully . Without realizing come , combat men squadron discovered dominated administrators appointed serve . They bullied , insulted , harassed shoved day long one . When voiced objection , Captain Black replied people loyal would mind signing loyalty oaths . To anyone questioned effectiveness loyalty oaths , replied people really owe allegiance country would proud pledge often forced . And anyone questioned morality , replied “ The Star-Spangled Banner ” greatest piece music ever composed . The loyalty oaths person signed , loyal ; Captain Black simple , Corporal Kolodny sign hundreds name day could always prove loyal anyone else . “ The important thing keep pledging , ” explained cohorts . “ It ’ matter whether mean . That ’ make little kids pledge allegiance even know ‘ pledge ’ ‘ allegiance ’ mean. ” To Captain Piltchard Captain Wren , Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade glorious pain ass , since complicated task organizing crews combat mission . Men tied squadron signing , pledging singing , missions took hours longer get way . Effective emergency action became impossible , Captain Piltchard Captain Wren timid raise outcry Captain Black , scrupulously enforced day doctrine “ Continual Reaffirmation ” originated , doctrine designed trap men become disloyal since last time signed loyalty oath day . It Captain Black came advice Captain Piltchard Captain Wren pitched bewildering predicament . He came delegation advised bluntly make man sign loyalty oath allowing fly combat mission . “ Of course , ’ , ” Captain Black pointed . “ Nobody ’ trying pressure . But everyone else making sign loyalty oaths , ’ going look mighty funny F.B.I . two ones ’ care enough country make sign loyalty oaths , . If want get bad reputation , ’ nobody ’ business . All ’ trying help. ” Milo convinced absolutely refused deprive Major Major food , even Major Major Communist , Milo secretly doubted . Milo nature opposed innovation threatened disrupt normal course affairs . Milo took firm moral stand absolutely refused participate Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade Captain Black called upon delegation requested . “ National defense everybody ’ job , ” Captain Black replied Milo ’ objection . “ And whole program voluntary , Milo-don ’ forget . The men ’ sign Piltchard Wren ’ loyalty oath ’ want . But need starve death ’ . It ’ like Catch-22 . Don ’ get ? You ’ Catch-22 , ? ” Doc Daneeka adamant . “ What makes sure Major Major Communist ? ” “ You never heard denying began accusing , ? And ’ see signing loyalty oaths. ” “ You ’ letting sign any. ” “ Of course , ” Captain Black explained . “ That would defeat whole purpose crusade . Look , ’ play ball us ’ want . But ’ point rest us working hard ’ going give Major Major medical attention minute Milo begins starving death ? I wonder ’ going think Group man ’ undermining whole security program . They ’ probably transfer Pacific. ” Doc Daneeka surrendered swiftly . “ I ’ go tell Gus Wes whatever want to. ” Up Group , Colonel Cathcart already begun wondering going . “ It ’ idiot Black patriotism binge , ” Colonel Korn reported smile . “ I think ’ better play ball , since ’ one promoted Major Major squadron commander. ” “ That idea , ” Colonel Cathcart accused Petulantly . “ I never let talk it. ” “ And good idea , , ” retorted Colonel Korn , “ since eliminated superfluous major ’ giving awful black eye administrator . Don ’ worry , probably run course soon . The best thing send Captain Black letter total support hope drops dead much damage. ” Colonel Korn struck whimsical thought . “ I wonder ! You ’ suppose imbecile try turn Major Major trailer , ? ” “ The next thing ’ got turn bastard Major Major trailer , ” Captain Black decided . “ I ’ like turn wife kids woods , . But ’ . He wife kids . So ’ make turn . Who ’ charge tents ? ” “ He is. ” “ You see ? ” cried Captain Black . “ They ’ taking everything ! Well , I ’ going stand . I ’ take matter right Major -- de Coverley I . I ’ Milo speak minute gets back Rome. ” Captain Black boundless faith wisdom , power justice Major -- de Coverley , even though never spoken still found without courage . He deputized Milo speak Major -- de Coverley stormed impatiently waited tall executive officer return . Along everyone else squadron , lived profound awe reverence majestic , white-haired major craggy face Jehovean bearing , came back Rome finally injured eye inside new celluloid eye patch smashed whole Glorious Crusade bits single stroke . Milo carefully said nothing Major -- de Coverley stepped mess hall fierce austere dignity day returned found way blocked wall officers waiting line sign loyalty oaths . At far end food counter , group men arrived earlier pledging allegiance flag , trays food balanced one hand , order allowed take seats table . Already tables , group arrived still earlier singing “ The Star-Spangled Banner ” order might use salt pepper ketchup . The hubbub began subside slowly Major -- de Coverley paused doorway frown puzzled disapproval , though viewing something bizarre . He started forward straight line , wall officers parted like Red Sea . Glancing neither left right , strode indomitably steam counter , clear , full-bodied voice gruff age resonant ancient eminence authority , said : “ Gim eat. ” Instead eat , Corporal Snark gave Major -- de Coverley loyalty oath sign . Major -- de Coverley swept away mighty displeasure moment recognized , good eye flaring blindingly fiery disdain enormous old corrugated face darkening mountainous wrath . “ Gim eat , I said , ” ordered loudly harsh tones rumbled ominously silent tent like claps distant thunder . Corporal Snark turned pale began tremble . He glanced toward Milo pleadingly guidance . For several terrible seconds sound . Then Milo nodded . “ Give eat , ” said . Corporal Snark began giving Major -- de Coverley eat . Major -- de Coverley turned counter tray full came stop . His eyes fell groups officers gazing mute appeal , , righteous belligerence , roared : “ Give everybody eat ! ” “ Give everybody eat ! ” Milo echoed joyful relief , Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade came end . Captain Black deeply disillusioned treacherous stab back someone high place upon relied confidently support . Major -- de Coverley let . “ Oh , ’ bother bit , ” responded cheerfully everyone came sympathy . “ We completed task . Our purpose make everyone ’ like afraid alert people danger Major Major , certainly succeeded . Since ’ going let sign loyalty oaths anyway , ’ really matter whether not. ” Seeing everyone squadron ’ like afraid throughout appalling , interminable Great Big Siege Bologna reminded Captain Black nostalgically good old days Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade man real consequence , even big shots like Milo Minderbinder , Doc Daneeka Piltchard Wren trembled approach groveled feet . To prove newcomers really man consequence , still letter commendation received Colonel Cathcart . 12 BOLOGNA Actually , Captain Black Sergeant Knight triggered solemn panic Bologna , slipping silently truck two extra flak suits soon learned target signaling start grim procession back parachute tent degenerated frantic stampede finally extra flak suits gone . “ Hey , ’ going ? ” Kid Sampson asked nervously . “ Bologna ’ rough , ? ” Nately , sitting trancelike floor truck , held grave young face hands answer . It Sergeant Knight cruel series postponements , climbing planes first morning , along came jeep news raining Bologna mission would delayed . It raining Pianosa time returned squadron , rest day stare woodenly bomb line map awning intelligence tent ruminate hypnotically fact escape . The evidence vividly narrow red ribbon tacked across mainland : ground forces Italy pinned forty-two insurmountable miles south target could possibly capture city time . Nothing could save men Pianosa mission Bologna . They trapped . Their hope would never stop raining , hope knew would . When stop raining Pianosa , rained Bologna . When stopped raining Bologna , began Pianosa . If rain , freakish , inexplicable phenomena like epidemic diarrhea bomb line moved . Four times first six days assembled briefed sent back . Once , took flying formation control tower summoned . The rained , worse suffered . The worse suffered , prayed would continue raining . All night , men looked sky saddened stars . All day , looked bomb line big , wobbling easel map Italy blew wind dragged awning intelligence tent every time rain began . The bomb line scarlet band narrow satin ribbon delineated forwardmost position Allied ground forces every sector Italian mainland . The morning Hungry Joe ’ fist fight Huple ’ cat , rain stopped falling places . The landing strip began dry . It would take full twenty-four hours harden ; sky remained cloudless . The resentments incubating man hatched hatred . First hated infantrymen mainland failed capture Bologna . Then began hate bomb line . For hours stared relentlessly scarlet ribbon map hated would move high enough encompass city . When night fell , congregated darkness flashlights , continuing macabre vigil bomb line brooding entreaty though hoping move ribbon collective weight sullen prayers . “ I really ’ believe , ” Clevinger exclaimed Yossarian voice rising falling protest wonder . “ It ’ complete reversion primitive superstition . They ’ confusing cause effect . It makes much sense knocking wood crossing fingers . They really believe ’ fly mission tomorrow someone would tiptoe map middle night move bomb line Bologna . Can imagine ? You I must rational ones left. ” In middle night Yossarian knocked wood , crossed fingers , tiptoed tent move bomb line Bologna . Corporal Kolodny tiptoed stealthily Captain Black ’ tent early next morning , reached inside mosquito net gently shook moist shoulder-blade found Captain Black opened eyes . “ What waking ? ” whimpered Captain Black . “ They captured Bologna , sir , ” said Corporal Kolodny . “ I thought ’ want know . Is mission canceled ? ” Captain Black tugged erect began scratching scrawny long thighs methodically . In little dressed emerged tent , squinting , cross unshaven . The sky clear warm . He peered without emotion map . Sure enough , captured Bologna . Inside intelligence tent , Corporal Kolodny already removing maps Bologna navigation kits . Captain Black seated loud yawn , lifted feet top desk phoned Colonel Korn . “ What waking ? ” whimpered Colonel Korn . “ They captured Bologna night , sir . Is mission canceled ? ” “ What talking , Black ? ” Colonel Korn growled . “ Why mission canceled ? ” “ Because captured Bologna , sir . Isn ’ mission canceled ? ” “ Of course mission canceled . Do think ’ bombing troops ? ” “ What waking ? ” Colonel Cathcart whimpered Colonel Korn . “ They captured Bologna , ” Colonel Korn told . “ I thought ’ want know. ” “ Who captured Bologna ? ” “ We did. ” Colonel Cathcart overjoyed , relieved embarrassing commitment bomb Bologna without blemish reputation valor earned volunteering men . General Dreedle pleased capture Bologna , , although angry Colonel Moodus waking tell . Headquarters also pleased decided award medal officer captured city . There officer captured city , gave medal General Peckem instead , General Peckem officer sufficient initiative ask . As soon General Peckem received medal , began asking increased responsibility . It General Peckem ’ opinion combat units theater placed jurisdiction Special Service Corps , General Peckem commanding officer . If dropping bombs enemy special service , reflected aloud frequently martyred smile sweet reasonableness loyal confederate every dispute , could help wondering world . With amiable regret , declined offer combat post General Dreedle . “ Flying combat missions General Dreedle exactly I mind , ” explained indulgently smooth laugh . “ I thinking terms replacing General Dreedle , perhaps something General Dreedle I could exercise supervision great many generals . You see , precious abilities mainly administrative ones . I happy facility getting different people agree. ” “ He happy facility getting different people agree prick , ” Colonel Cargill confided invidiously ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen hope ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen would spread unfavorable report along Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters . “ If anyone deserves combat post , I . It even idea ask medal. ” “ You really want go combat ? ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen inquired . “ Combat ? ” Colonel Cargill aghast . “ Oh , no-you misunderstand . Of course , I ’ actually mind going combat , best abilities mainly administrative ones . I happy facility getting different people agree. ” “ He happy facility getting different people agree prick , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen confided laugh Yossarian , come Pianosa learn really true Milo Egyptian cotton . “ If anyone deserves promotion , I do. ” Actually , risen already ex-corporal , shot ranks shortly transfer Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters mail clerk busted right private making odious audible comparisons commissioned officers worked . The heady taste success infused morality fired ambition loftier attainments . “ Do want buy Zippo lighters ? ” asked Yossarian . “ They stolen right quartermaster. ” “ Does Milo know ’ selling cigarette lighters ? ” “ What ’ business ? Milo ’ carrying cigarette lighters , ? ” “ He sure , ” Yossarian told . “ And ’ stolen. ” “ That ’ think , ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen answered laconic snort . “ I ’ selling mine buck apiece . What ’ getting ? ” “ A dollar penny. ” Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen snickered triumphantly . “ I beat every time , ” gloated . “ Say , Egyptian cotton ’ stuck ? How much buy ? ” “ All. ” “ In whole world ? Well , I ’ damned ! ” ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen crowed malicious glee . “ What dope ! You Cairo . Why ’ let ? ” “ Me ? ” Yossarian answered shrug . “ I influence . It teletype machines good restaurants . Milo never seen stock ticker , quotation Egyptian cotton happened coming asked headwaiter explain . ‘ Egyptian cotton ? ’ Milo said look . ‘ How much Egyptian cotton selling ? ’ The next thing I knew bought whole goddam harvest . And ’ unload it. ” “ He imagination . I unload plenty black market ’ make deal. ” “ Milo knows black market . There ’ demand cotton. ” “ But demand medical supplies . I roll cotton wooden toothpicks peddle sterile swabs . Will sell good price ? ” “ He ’ sell price , ” Yossarian answered . “ He ’ pretty sore going competition . In fact , ’ pretty sore everybody getting diarrhea last weekend giving mess hall bad name . Say , help us. ” Yossarian suddenly seized arm . “ Couldn ’ forge official orders mimeograph machine get us flying Bologna ? ” Ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen pulled away slowly look scorn . “ Sure I could , ” explained pride . “ But I would never dream anything like that. ” “ Why ? ” “ Because ’ job . We jobs . My job unload Zippo lighters profit I pick cotton Milo . Your job bomb ammunition dumps Bologna. ” “ But I ’ going killed Bologna , ” Yossarian pleaded . “ We ’ going killed. ” “ Then ’ killed , ” replied ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . “ Why ’ fatalist way I ? If I ’ destined unload lighters profit pick Egyptian cotton cheap Milo , ’ I ’ going . And ’ destined killed Bologna , ’ going killed , might well go die like man . I hate say , Yossarian , ’ turning chronic complainer. ” Clevinger agreed ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen Yossarian ’ job get killed Bologna livid condemnation Yossarian confessed moved bomb line caused mission canceled . “ Why hell ? ” Yossarian snarled , arguing vehemently suspected wrong . “ Am I supposed get ass shot colonel wants general ? ” “ What men mainland ? ” Clevinger demanded much emotion . “ Are supposed get asses shot ’ want go ? Those men entitled air support ! ” “ But necessarily . Look , ’ care knocks ammunition dumps . The reason ’ going bastard Cathcart volunteered us. ” “ Oh , I know , ” Clevinger assured , gaunt face pale agitated brown eyes swimming sincerity . “ But fact remains ammunition dumps still standing . You know well I ’ approve Colonel Cathcart do. ” Clevinger paused emphasis , mouth quivering , beat fist softly sleeping-bag . “ But ’ us determine targets must destroyed ’ destroy or- “ “ Or gets killed ? And ? ” “ Yes , even . We right question- “ “ You ’ insane ! ” “ -no right question- “ “ Do really mean ’ business I get killed Colonel Cathcart ’ ? Do really mean ? ” “ Yes , I , ” Clevinger insisted , seeming unsure . “ There men entrusted winning war much better position decide targets bombed. ” “ We talking two different things , ” Yossarian answered exaggerated weariness . “ You talking relationship Air Corps infantry , I talking relationship Colonel Cathcart . You talking winning war , I talking winning war keeping alive. ” “ Exactly , ” Clevinger snapped smugly . “ And think important ? ” “ To ? ” Yossarian shot back . “ Open eyes , Clevinger . It ’ make damned bit difference wins war someone ’ dead. ” Clevinger sat moment though ’ slapped . “ Congratulations ! ” exclaimed bitterly , thinnest milk-white line enclosing lips tightly bloodless , squeezing ring . “ I ’ think another attitude could depended upon give greater comfort enemy. ” “ The enemy , ” retorted Yossarian weighted precision , “ anybody ’ going get killed , matter side ’ , includes Colonel Cathcart . And ’ forget , longer remember , longer might live. ” But Clevinger forget , dead . At time , Clevinger upset incident Yossarian dare tell also responsible epidemic diarrhea caused unnecessary postponement . Milo even upset possibility someone poisoned squadron , came bustling fretfully Yossarian assistance . “ Please find Corporal Snark put laundry soap sweet potatoes , ” requested furtively . “ Corporal Snark trusts tell truth give word ’ tell anyone else . As soon tells , come tell me. ” “ Of course I put laundry soap sweet potatoes , ” Corporal Snark admitted Yossarian . “ That ’ asked , ’ ? Laundry soap best way. ” “ He swears God ’ thing , ” Yossarian reported back Milo . Milo pouted dubiously . “ Dunbar says God. ” There hope left . By middle second week , everyone squadron began look like Hungry Joe , scheduled fly screamed horribly sleep . He one could sleep . All night long , men moved darkness outside tents like tongueless wraiths cigarettes . In daytime stared bomb line futile , drooping clusters still figure Doc Daneeka sitting front closed door medical tent beneath morbid hand-lettered sign . They began invent humorless , glum jokes disastrous rumors destruction awaiting Bologna . Yossarian sidled drunkenly Colonel Korn officers ’ club one night kid new Lepage gun Germans moved . “ What Lepage gun ? ” Colonel Korn inquired curiosity . “ The new three-hundred-and-forty-four-millimeter Lepage glue gun , ” Yossarian answered . “ It glues whole formation planes together mid-air. ” Colonel Korn jerked elbow free Yossarian ’ clutching fingers startled affront . “ Let go , idiot ! ” cried furiously , glaring vindictive approval Nately leaped upon Yossarian ’ back pulled away . “ Who lunatic , anyway ? ” Colonel Cathcart chortled merrily . “ That ’ man made give medal Ferrara . You promote captain , , remember ? It serves right. ” Nately lighter Yossarian great difficulty maneuvering Yossarian ’ lurching bulk across room unoccupied table . “ Are crazy ? ” Nately kept hissing trepidation . “ That Colonel Korn . Are crazy ? ” Yossarian wanted another drink promised leave quietly Nately brought one . Then made Nately bring two . When Nately finally coaxed door , Captain Black came stomping outside , banging sloshing shoes hard wood floor spilling water eaves like high roof . “ Boy , bastards ! ” announced exuberantly , splashing away puddle forming feet . “ I got call Colonel Korn . Do know ’ got waiting Bologna ? Ha ! Ha ! They ’ got new Lepage glue gun . It glues whole formation planes together mid-air. ” “ My God , ’ true ! ” Yossarian shrieked , collapsed Nately terror . “ There God , ” answered Dunbar calmly , coming slight stagger . “ Hey , give hand , ? I ’ got get back tent. ” “ Says ? ” “ Says . Gee , look rain. ” “ We ’ got get car. ” “ Steal Captain Black ’ car , ” said Yossarian . “ That ’ I always do. ” “ We ’ steal anybody ’ car . Since began stealing nearest car every time wanted one , nobody leaves ignition on. ” “ Hop , ” said Chief White Halfoat , driving drunk covered jeep . He waited crowded inside spurted ahead suddenness rolled backward . He roared laughter curses . He drove straight ahead left parking lot rammed car embankment side road . The others piled forward helpless heap began cursing . “ I forgot turn , ” explained . “ Be careful , ? ” Nately cautioned . “ You ’ better put headlights on. ” Chief White Halfoat pulled back reverse , made turn shot away road top speed . The wheels sibilant whizzing blacktop surface . “ Not fast , ” urged Nately . “ You ’ better take squadron first I help put bed . Then drive back squadron. ” “ Who hell ? ” “ Dunbar. ” “ Hey , put headlights , ” Nately shouted . “ And watch road ! ” “ They . Isn ’ Yossarian car ? That ’ reason I let rest bastards in. ” Chief White Halfoat turned completely around stare back seat . “ Watch road ! ” “ Yossarian ? Is Yossarian ? ” “ I ’ , Chief . Let ’ go home . What makes sure ? You never answered question. ” “ You see ? I told here. ” “ What question ? ” “ Whatever talking about. ” “ Was important ? ” “ I ’ remember important .

It ’ rain windshield makes look dark back there. ” “ Beautiful , beautiful rain. ” “ I hope never stops raining . Rain , rain , go a- “ “ -way . Come a- “ “ -again oth- “ “ -er day . Little Yo-Yo wants- “ “ -to play . In- “ “ -the meadow , in- “ Chief White Halfoat missed next turn road ran jeep way crest steep embankment . Rolling back , jeep turned side settled softly mud . There frightened silence . “ Is everyone right ? ” Chief White Halfoat inquired hushed voice . No one injured , heaved long sigh relief . “ You know , ’ trouble , ” groaned . “ I never listen anybody . Somebody kept telling put headlights , I ’ listen. ” “ I kept telling put headlights on. ” “ I know , I know . And I ’ listen , would I ? I wish I drink . I drink . Look . It ’ broken. ” “ It ’ raining , ” Nately noticed . “ I ’ getting wet. ” Chief White Halfoat got bottle rye open , drank handed . Lying tangled top , drank Nately , kept groping ineffectually door handle . The bottle fell head clunk , whiskey poured neck . He began writhing convulsively . “ Hey , ’ got get ! ” cried . “ We ’ drown. ” “ Is anybody ? ” asked Clevinger concern , shining flashlight top . “ It ’ Clevinger ! ” shouted , tried pull window reached aid . “ Look ! ” Clevinger exclaimed indignantly McWatt , sat grinning wheel staff car . “ Lying like bunch drunken animals . You , Nately ? You ought ashamed ! Come on-help get die pneumonia. ” “ You know , ’ sound like bad idea , ” Chief White Halfoat reflected . “ I think I die pneumonia. ” “ Why ? ” “ Why ? ” answered Chief White Halfoat , lay back mud contentedly bottle rye cuddled arms . “ Oh , look ’ ! ” Clevinger exclaimed irritation . “ Will get get car go back squadron ? ” “ We ’ go back . Someone stay help Chief car signed motor pool. ” Chief White Halfoat settled back staff car ebullient , prideful chuckle . “ That ’ Captain Black ’ car , ” informed jubilantly . “ I stole officers ’ club extra set keys thought lost morning. ” “ Well , I ’ damned ! That calls drink. ” “ Haven ’ enough drink ? ” Clevinger began scolding soon McWatt started car . “ Look . You ’ care drink death drown death , ? ” “ Just long ’ fly death. ” “ Hey , open , open , ” Chief White Halfoat urged McWatt . “ And turn headlights . That ’ way it. ” “ Doc Daneeka right , ” Clevinger went . “ People ’ know enough take care . I really disgusted you. ” “ Okay , fatmouth , car , ” Chief White Halfoat ordered . “ Everybody get car Yossarian . Where ’ Yossarian ? ” “ Get hell me. ” Yossarian laughed , pushing away . “ You ’ covered mud. ” Clevinger focused Nately . “ You ’ one really surprises . Do know smell like ? Instead trying keep trouble , get drunk . Suppose got another fight Appleby ? ” Clevinger ’ eyes opened wide alarm heard Yossarian chuckle . “ He ’ get another fight Appleby , ? ” “ Not time , ” said Dunbar . “ No , time . This time I even better. ” “ This time got fight Colonel Korn. ” “ He ’ ! ” gasped Clevinger . “ He ? ” exclaimed Chief White Halfoat delight . “ That calls drink. ” “ But ’ terrible ! ” Clevinger declared deep apprehension . “ Why world pick Colonel Korn ? Say , happened lights ? Why everything dark ? ” “ I turned , ” answered McWatt . “ You know , Chief White Halfoat right . It ’ much better headlights off. ” “ Are crazy ? ” Clevinger screamed , lunged forward snap headlights . He whirled around upon Yossarian near hysteria . “ You see ’ ? You ’ got acting like ! Suppose stops raining fly Bologna tomorrow . You ’ fine physical condition. ” “ It ’ ever gon na stop raining . No , sir , rain like really might go forever. ” “ It stopped raining ! ” someone said , whole car fell silent . “ You poor bastards , ” Chief White Halfoat murmured compassionately moments passed . “ Did really stop raining ? ” Yossarian asked meekly . McWatt switched windshield wipers make certain . The rain stopped . The sky starting clear . The moon sharp behind gauzy brown mist . “ Oh , well , ” sang McWatt soberly . “ What hell. ” “ Don ’ worry , fellas , ” Chief White Halfoat said . “ The landing strip soft use tomorrow . Maybe ’ start raining field dries out. ” “ You goddam stinking lousy son bitch , ” Hungry Joe screamed tent sped squadron . “ Jesus , back tonight ? I thought still Rome courier ship. ” “ Oh ! Ooooh ! Oooooooh ! ” Hungry Joe screamed . Chief White Halfoat shuddered . “ That guy gives willies , ” confessed grouchy whisper . “ Hey , whatever happened Captain Flume ? ” “ There ’ guy gives willies . I saw woods last week eating wild berries . He never sleeps trailer . He looked like hell. ” “ Hungry Joe ’ afraid ’ replace somebody goes sick call , even though sick call . Did see night tried kill Havermeyer fell Yossarian ’ slit trench ? ” “ Ooooh ! ” screamed Hungry Joe . “ Oh ! Ooooh ! Ooooooh ! ” “ It sure pleasure Flume around mess hall .

His agony terrifying , piercing , unearthly howl split moonlit dark vibrating impact seconds afterward like devastating shock . A numbing silence followed , riotous din rose inside tent . Yossarian among first ones . When burst entrance , Hungry Joe gun struggling wrench arm free Huple shoot cat , kept spitting feinting ferociously distract shooting Huple . Both humans GI underwear . The unfrosted light bulb overhead swinging crazily loose wire , jumbled black shadows kept swirling bobbing chaotically , entire tent seemed reeling . Yossarian reached instinctively balance launched forward prodigious dive crushed three combatants ground beneath . He emerged melee scruff neck hand-Hungry Joe ’ neck cat ’ . Hungry Joe cat glared savagely . The cat spat viciously Hungry Joe , Hungry Joe tried hit haymaker . “ A fair fight , ” Yossarian decreed , others come running uproar horror began cheering ecstatically tremendous overflow relief . “ We ’ fair fight , ” explained officially Hungry Joe cat carried outside , still holding apart scruffs necks . “ Fists , fangs claws . But guns , ” warned Hungry Joe . “ And spitting , ” warned cat sternly . “ When I turn loose , go . Break clean clinches come back fighting . Go ! ” There huge , giddy crowd men avid diversion , cat turned chicken moment Yossarian released fled Hungry Joe ignominiously like yellow dog . Hungry Joe declared winner . He swaggered away happily proud smile champion , shriveled head high emaciated chest . He went back bed victorious dreamed Huple ’ cat sleeping face , suffocating . 13 MAJOR -- DE COVERLEY Moving bomb line fool Germans , fool Major -- de Coverley , packed musette bag , commandeered airplane , impression Florence captured Allies , flown city rent two apartments officers enlisted men squadron use rest leaves . He still returned time Yossarian jumped back outside Major Major ’ office wondered appeal next help . Major -- de Coverley splendid , awe-inspiring , grave old man massive leonine head angry shock wild white hair raged like blizzard around stern , patriarchal face . His duties squadron executive officer consist entirely , Doc Daneeka Major Major conjectured , pitching horseshoes , kidnaping Italian laborers , renting apartments enlisted men officers use rest leaves , excelled three . Each time fall city like Naples , Rome Florence seemed imminent , Major -- de Coverley would pack musette bag , commandeer airplane pilot , flown away , accomplishing without uttering word , sheer force solemn , domineering visage peremptory gestures wrinkled finger . A day two city fell , would back leases two large luxurious apartments , one officers one enlisted men , already staffed competent , jolly cooks maids . A days , newspapers would appear throughout world photographs first American soldiers bludgeoning way shattered city rubble smoke . Inevitably , Major -- de Coverley among , seated straight ramrod jeep obtained somewhere , glancing neither right left artillery fire burst invincible head lithe young infantrymen carbines went loping along sidewalks shelter burning buildings fell dead doorways . He seemed eternally indestructible sat surrounded danger , features molded firmly fierce , regal , forbidding countenance recognized revered every man squadron . To German intelligence , Major -- de Coverley vexatious enigma ; one hundreds American prisoners would ever supply concrete information elderly white-haired officer gnarled menacing brow blazing , powerful eyes seemed spearhead every important advance fearlessly successfully . To American authorities identity equally perplexing ; whole regiment crack C.I.D . men thrown front lines find , battalion combat-hardened public-relations officers stood red alert twenty-four hours day orders begin publicizing moment located . In Rome , Major -- de Coverley outdone apartments . For officers , arrived groups four five , immense double room new white stone building , three spacious bathrooms walls shimmering aquamarine tile one skinny maid named Michaela tittered everything kept apartment spotless order . On landing lived obsequious owners . On landing lived beautiful rich black-haired Countess beautiful , rich black-haired daughter-in-law , would put Nately , shy want , Aarfy , stuffy take tried dissuade ever putting anyone husbands , chosen remain north family ’ business interests . “ They ’ really couple good kids , ” Aarfy confided earnestly Yossarian , whose recurring dream nude milk-white female bodies beautiful rich black-haired good kids lying stretched bed erotically time . The enlisted men descended upon Rome gangs twelve Gargantuan appetites heavy crates filled canned food women cook serve dining room apartment sixth floor red brick building clinking elevator . There always activity enlisted men ’ place . There always enlisted men , begin , women cook serve sweep scrub , always gay silly sensual young girls Yossarian found brought sleepy enlisted men returning Pianosa exhausting seven-day debauch brought leaving behind whoever wanted next . The girls shelter food long wanted stay . All return hump men asked , seemed make everything perfect . Every fourth day Hungry Joe came crashing like man torment , hoarse , wild , frenetic , unlucky enough finish missions flying courier ship . Most times slept enlisted men ’ apartment . Nobody certain many rooms Major -- de Coverley rented , even stout black-bodiced woman corsets first floor rented . They covered whole top floor , Yossarian knew extended fifth floor well , Snowden ’ room fifth floor finally found maid lime-colored panties dust mop day Bologna , Hungry Joe discovered bed Luciana officers ’ apartment morning gone running like fiend camera . The maid lime-colored panties cheerful , fat , obliging woman mid-thirties squashy thighs swaying hams lime-colored panties always rolling man wanted . She plain broad face virtuous woman alive : laid everybody , regardless race , creed , color place national origin , donating sociably act hospitality , procrastinating even moment might take discard cloth broom dust mop clutching time grabbed . Her allure stemmed accessibility ; like Mt . Everest , , men climbed top time felt urge . Yossarian love maid lime-colored panties seemed woman left could make love without falling love . Even bald-headed girl Sicily still evoked strong sensations pity , tenderness regret . Despite multiple perils Major -- de Coverley exposed time rented apartments , injury occurred , ironically enough , leading triumphal procession open city Rome , wounded eye flower fired close range seedy , cackling , intoxicated old man , , like Satan , bounded Major -- de Coverley ’ car malicious glee , seized roughly contemptuously venerable white head kissed mockingly cheek mouth reeking sour fumes wine , cheese garlic , dropping back joyous celebrating throngs hollow , dry , excoriating laugh . Major -- de Coverley , Spartan adversity , flinch throughout whole hideous ordeal . And returned Pianosa , business Rome completed , seek medical attention wound . He resolved remain binocular specified Doc Daneeka eye patch transparent could continue pitching horseshoes , kidnaping Italian laborers renting apartments unimpaired vision . To men squadron , Major -- de Coverley colossus , although never dared tell . The one ever dare address Milo Minderbinder , approached horseshoe-pitching pit hard-boiled egg second week squadron held aloft Major -- de Coverley see . Major -- de Coverley straightened astonishment Milo ’ effrontery concentrated upon full fury storming countenance rugged overhang gullied forehead huge crag humpbacked nose came charging face wrathfully like Big Ten fullback . Milo stood ground , taking shelter behind hard-boiled egg raised protectively face like magic charm . In time gale began subside , danger passed . “ What ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded last . “ An egg , ” Milo answered “ What kind egg ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ A hard-boiled egg , ” Milo answered . “ What kind hard-boiled egg ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ A fresh hard-boiled egg , ” Milo answered . “ Where fresh egg come ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ From chicken , ” Milo answered . “ Where chicken ? ” Major -- de Coverley demanded . “ The chicken Malta , ” Milo answered . “ How many chickens Malta ? ” “ Enough chickens lay fresh eggs every officer squadron five cents apiece mess fund , ” Milo answered . “ I weakness fresh eggs , ” Major -- de Coverley confessed . “ If someone put plane disposal , I could fly week squadron plane bring back fresh eggs need , ” Milo answered . “ After , Malta ’ far away. ” “ Malta ’ far away , ” Major -- de Coverley observed . “ You could probably fly week squadron plane bring back fresh eggs need. ” “ Yes , ” Milo agreed . “ I suppose I could , someone wanted put plane disposal. ” “ I like fresh eggs fried , ” Major -- de Coverley remembered . “ In fresh butter. ” “ I find fresh butter need Sicily twenty-five cents pound , ” Milo answered . “ Twenty-five cents pound fresh butter good buy . There ’ enough money mess fund butter , could probably sell squadrons profit get back pay own. ” “ What ’ name , son ? ” asked Major -- de Coverley . “ My name Milo Minderbinder , sir . I twenty-seven years old. ” “ You ’ good mess officer , Milo. ” “ I ’ mess officer , sir. ” “ You ’ good mess officer , Milo. ” “ Thank , sir . I ’ everything power good mess officer. ” “ Bless , boy . Have horseshoe. ” “ Thank , sir . What I ? ” “ Throw it. ” “ Away ? ” “ At peg . Then pick throw peg . It ’ game , see ? You get horseshoe back. ” “ Yes , sir . I see . How much horseshoes selling ? ” The smell fresh egg snapping exotically pool fresh butter carried long way Mediterranean trade winds brought General Dreedle racing back voracious appetite , accompanied nurse , accompanied everywhere , son-in-law , Colonel Moodus . In beginning General Dreedle devoured meals Milo ’ mess hall . Then three squadrons Colonel Cathcart ’ group turned mess halls Milo gave airplane pilot could buy fresh eggs fresh butter . Milo ’ planes shuttled back forth seven days week every officer four squadrons began devouring fresh eggs insatiable orgy fresh-egg eating . General Dreedle devoured fresh eggs breakfast , lunch dinner-between meals devoured fresh eggs-until Milo located abundant sources fresh veal , beef , duck , baby lamb chops , mushroom caps , broccoli , South African rock lobster tails , shrimp , hams , puddings , grapes , ice cream , strawberries artichokes . There three bomb groups General Dreedle ’ combat wing , jealously dispatched planes Malta fresh eggs , discovered fresh eggs selling seven cents apiece . Since could buy Milo five cents apiece , made sense turn mess halls syndicate , , give planes pilots needed ferry good food promised supply well . Everyone elated turn events , Colonel Cathcart , convinced feather cap . He greeted Milo jovially time met , excess contrite generosity , impulsively recommended Major Major promotion . The recommendation rejected Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , scribbled brusque , unsigned reminder Army one Major Major Major Major intend lose promotion please Colonel Cathcart . Colonel Cathcart stung blunt rebuke skulked guiltily room smarting repudiation . He blamed Major Major black eye decided bust lieutenant day . “ They probably ’ let , ” Colonel Korn remarked condescending smile , savoring situation . “ For precisely reasons ’ let promote . Besides , ’ certainly look foolish trying bust lieutenant right tried promote rank. ” Colonel Cathcart felt hemmed every side . He much successful obtaining medal Yossarian debacle Ferrara , bridge spanning Po still standing undamaged seven days Colonel Cathcart volunteered destroy . Nine missions men flown six days , bridge demolished tenth mission seventh day , Yossarian killed Kraft crew taking flight six planes target second time . Yossarian came carefully second bomb run brave . He buried head bombsight bombs away ; looked , everything inside ship suffused weird orange glow . At first thought plane fire . Then spied plane burning engine directly screamed McWatt intercom turn left hard . A second later , wing Kraft ’ plane blew . The flaming wreck dropped , first fuselage , spinning wing , shower tiny metal fragments began tap dancing roof Yossarian ’ plane incessant cachung ! cachung ! cachung ! flak still thumping around . Back ground , every eye watched grimly walked dull dejection Captain Black outside green clapboard briefing room make intelligence report learned Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn waiting speak inside . Major Danby stood barring door , waving everyone else away ashen silence . Yossarian leaden fatigue longed remove sticky clothing . He stepped briefing room mixed emotions , uncertain supposed feel Kraft others , died distance mute secluded agony moment ass vile , excruciating dilemma duty damnation . Colonel Cathcart , hand , broken event . “ Twice ? ” asked . “ I would missed first time , ” Yossarian replied softly , face lowered . Their voices echoed slightly long , narrow bungalow . “ But twice ? ” Colonel Cathcart repeated , vivid disbelief . “ I would missed first time , ” Yossarian repeated . “ But Kraft would alive. ” “ And bridge would still up. ” “ A trained bombardier supposed drop bombs first time , ” Colonel Cathcart reminded . “ The five bombardiers dropped bombs first time. ” “ And missed target , ” Yossarian said . “ We ’ go back again. ” “ And maybe would gotten first time then. ” “ And maybe I ’ gotten all. ” “ But maybe ’ losses. ” “ And maybe would losses , bridge still left standing . I thought wanted bridge destroyed. ” “ Don ’ contradict , ” Colonel Cathcart said . “ We ’ enough trouble. ” “ I ’ contradicting , sir. ” “ Yes . Even ’ contradiction. ” “ Yes , sir . I ’ sorry. ” Colonel Cathcart cracked knuckles violently . Colonel Korn , stocky , dark , flaccid man shapeless paunch , sat completely relaxed one benches front row , hands clasped comfortably top bald swarthy head . His eyes amused behind glinting rimless spectacles . “ We ’ trying perfectly objective , ” prompted Colonel Cathcart . “ We ’ trying perfectly objective , ” Colonel Cathcart said Yossarian zeal sudden inspiration . “ It ’ I ’ sentimental anything . I ’ give damn men airplane . It ’ looks lousy report . How I going cover something like report ? ” “ Why ’ give medal ? ” Yossarian suggested timidly . “ For going around twice ? ” “ You gave one Hungry Joe cracked airplane mistake. ” Colonel Cathcart snickered ruefully . “ You ’ lucky ’ give court-martial. ” “ But I got bridge second time around , ” Yossarian protested . “ I thought wanted bridge destroyed. ” “ Oh , I ’ know I wanted , ” Colonel Cathcart cried exasperation . “ Look , course I wanted bridge destroyed . That bridge source trouble ever since I decided send men get . But ’ first time ? ” “ I ’ enough time . My navigator ’ sure right city. ” “ The right city ? ” Colonel Cathcart baffled . “ Are trying blame Aarfy ? ” “ No , sir . It mistake letting distract . All I ’ trying say I ’ infallible. ” “ Nobody infallible , ” Colonel Cathcart said sharply , continued vaguely , afterthought : “ Nobody indispensable , either. ” There rebuttal . Colonel Korn stretched sluggishly . “ We ’ got reach decision , ” observed casually Colonel Cathcart . “ We ’ got reach decision , ” Colonel Cathcart said Yossarian . “ And ’ fault . Why go around twice ? Why ’ drop bombs first time like others ? ” “ I would missed first time. ” “ It seems ’ going around twice , ” Colonel Korn interrupted chuckle . “ But going ? ” Colonel Cathcart exclaimed distress . “ The others waiting outside. ” “ Why ’ give medal ? ” Colonel Korn proposed . “ For going around twice ? What give medal ? ” “ For going around twice , ” Colonel Korn answered reflective , self-satisfied smile . “ After , I suppose take lot courage go target second time planes around divert antiaircraft fire . And hit bridge . You know , might answer-to act boastfully something ought ashamed . That ’ trick never seems fail. ” “ Do think work ? ” “ I ’ sure .

And captain ’ much difference. ” “ All right , ” Colonel Cathcart decided . “ We ’ give medal brave enough go around target twice . And ’ make captain , too. ” Colonel Korn reached hat . “ Exit smiling , ” joked , put arm around Yossarian ’ shoulders stepped outside door . 14 KID SAMPSON By time mission Bologna , Yossarian brave enough go around target even , found aloft finally nose Kid Sampson ’ plane , pressed button throat mike asked , “ Well ? What ’ wrong plane ? ” Kid Sampson let shriek . “ Is something wrong plane ? What ’ matter ? ” Kid Sampson ’ cry turned Yossarian ice . “ Is something matter ? ” yelled horror . “ Are bailing ? ” “ I ’ know ! ” Kid Sampson shot back anguish , wailing excitedly . “ Someone said ’ bailing ! Who , anyway ? Who ? ” “ This Yossarian nose ! Yossarian nose . I heard say something matter . Didn ’ say something matter ? ” “ I thought said something wrong . Everything seems okay . Everything right. ” Yossarian ’ heart sank . Something terribly wrong everything right excuse turning back . He hesitated gravely . “ I ’ hear , ” said . “ I said everything right. ” The sun blinding white porcelain-blue water flashing edges airplanes . Yossarian took hold colored wires leading jackbox intercom system tore loose . “ I still ’ hear , ” said . He heard nothing . Slowly collected map case three flak suits crawled back main compartment . Nately , sitting stiffly co-pilot ’ seat , spied corner eye stepped flight deck behind Kid Sampson . He smiled Yossarian wanly , looking frail exceptionally young bashful bulky dungeon earphones , hat , throat mike , flak suit parachute . Yossarian bent close Kid Sampson ’ ear . “ I still ’ hear , ” shouted even drone engines . Kid Sampson glanced back surprise . Kid Sampson angular , comical face arched eyebrows scrawny blond mustache . “ What ? ” called shoulder . “ I still ’ hear , ” Yossarian repeated . “ You ’ talk louder , ” Kid Sampson said . “ I still ’ hear you. ” “ I said I still ’ hear ! ” Yossarian yelled . “ I ’ help , ” Kid Sampson yelled back . “ I ’ shouting loud I can. ” “ I ’ hear intercom , ” Yossarian bellowed mounting helplessness . “ You ’ turn back. ” “ For intercom ? ” asked Kid Sampson incredulously . “ Turn back , ” said Yossarian , “ I break head. ” Kid Sampson looked moral support toward Nately , stared away pointedly . Yossarian outranked . Kid Sampson resisted doubtfully another moment capitulated eagerly triumphant whoop . “ That ’ fine , ” announced gladly , blew shrill series whistles mustache . “ Yes sirree , ’ fine old Kid Sampson. ” He whistled shouted intercom , “ Now hear , little chickadees . This Admiral Kid Sampson talking . This Admiral Kid Sampson squawking , pride Queen ’ marines . Yessiree . We ’ turning back , boys , crackee , ’ turning back ! ” Nately ripped hat earphones one jubilant sweep began rocking back forth happily like handsome child high chair . Sergeant Knight came plummeting top gun turret began pounding back delirious enthusiasm . Kid Sampson turned plane away formation wide , graceful arc headed toward airfield . When Yossarian plugged headset one auxiliary jackboxes , two gunners rear section plane singing “ La Cucaracha. ” Back field , party fizzled abruptly . An uneasy silence replaced , Yossarian sober self-conscious climbed plane took place jeep already waiting . None men spoke drive back heavy , mesmerizing quiet blanketing mountains , sea forests . The feeling desolation persisted turned road squadron . Yossarian got car last . After minute , Yossarian gentle warm wind things stirring haunting tranquillity hung like drug vacated tents . The squadron stood insensate , bereft everything human Doc Daneeka , roosted dolorously like shivering turkey buzzard beside closed door medical tent , stuffed nose jabbing away thirsting futility hazy sunlight streaming around . Yossarian knew Doc Daneeka would go swimming . Doc Daneeka would never go swimming ; person could swoon suffer mild coronary occlusion inch two water drown death , carried sea undertow , made vulnerable poliomyelitis meningococcus infection chilling over-exertion . The threat Bologna others instilled Doc Daneeka even poignant solicitude safety . At night , heard burglars . Through lavender gloom clouding entrance operations tent , Yossarian glimpsed Chief White Halfoat , diligently embezzling whiskey rations , forging signatures nondrinkers pouring alcohol poisoning separate bottles rapidly order steal much could Captain Black roused recollection came hurrying indolently steal rest . The jeep started softly . Kid Sampson , Nately others wandered apart noiseless eddy motion sucked away cloying yellow stillness . The jeep vanished cough . Yossarian alone ponderous , primeval lull everything green looked black everything else imbued color pus . The breeze rustled leaves dry diaphanous distance . He restless , scared sleepy . The sockets eyes felt grimy exhaustion . Wearily moved inside parachute tent long table smoothed wood , nagging bitch doubt burrowing painlessly inside conscience felt perfectly clear . He left flak suit parachute crossed back past water wagon intelligence tent return map case Captain Black , sat drowsing chair skinny long legs desk inquired indifferent curiosity Yossarian ’ plane turned back . Yossarian ignored . He set map counter walked . Back tent , squirmed parachute harness clothes . Orr Rome , due back afternoon rest leave ditching plane waters Genoa . Nately would already packing replace , entranced find still alive undoubtedly impatient resume wasted heartbreaking courtship prostitute Rome . When Yossarian undressed , sat cot rest . He felt much better soon naked . He never felt comfortable clothes . In little put fresh undershorts back set beach moccasins , khaki-colored bath towel draped shoulders . The path squadron led around mysterious gun emplacement woods ; two three enlisted men stationed lay sleeping circle sand bags third sat eating purple pomegranate , biting large mouthfuls churning jaws spewing ground roughage away bushes . When bit , red juice ran mouth . Yossarian padded ahead forest , caressing bare , tingling belly adoringly time time though reassure still . He rolled piece lint navel . Along ground suddenly , sides path , saw dozens new mushrooms rain spawned poking nodular fingers clammy earth like lifeless stalks flesh , sprouting necrotic profusion everywhere looked seemed proliferating right eyes . There thousands swarming far back underbrush could see , appeared swell size multiply number spied . He hurried away shiver eerie alarm slacken pace soil crumbled dry sand beneath feet left behind . He glanced back apprehensively , half expecting find limp white things crawling sightless pursuit snaking treetops writhing ungovernable mutative mass . The beach deserted . The sounds hushed ones , bloated gurgle stream , respirating hum tall grass shrubs behind , apathetic moaning dumb , translucent waves . The surf always small , water clear cool . Yossarian left things sand moved knee-high waves completely immersed . On side sea , bumpy sliver dark land lay wrapped mist , almost invisible . He swam languorously raft , held moment , swam languorously back could stand sand bar . He submerged head first green water several times felt clean wide-awake stretched face sand slept planes returning Bologna almost overhead great , cumulative rumble many engines came crashing slumber earth-shattering roar . He woke blinking slight pain head opened eyes upon world boiling chaos everything proper order . He gasped utter amazement fantastic sight twelve flights planes organized calmly exact formation . The scene unexpected true . There planes spurting ahead wounded , none lagging behind damage . No distress flares smoked sky . No ship missing . For instant paralyzed sensation madness . Then understood , almost wept irony . The explanation simple : clouds covered target planes could bomb , mission Bologna still flown . He wrong . There clouds . Bologna bombed . Bologna milk run . There flak . 15 PILTCHARD amp ; WREN Captain Piltchard Captain Wren , inoffensive joint squadron operations officers , mild , soft-spoken men less middle height enjoyed flying combat missions begged nothing life Colonel Cathcart opportunity continue flying . They flown hundreds combat missions wanted fly hundreds . They assigned every one . Nothing wonderful war ever happened ; afraid might never happen . They conducted duties humbly reticently , minimum fuss , went great lengths antagonize anyone . They smiled quickly everyone passed . When spoke , mumbled . They shifty , cheerful , subservient men comfortable never met anyone else ’ eye , even Yossarian ’ eye open-air meeting called reprimand publicly making Kid Sampson turn back mission Bologna . “ Fellas , ” said Captain Piltchard , thinning dark hair smiled awkwardly . “ When turn back mission , try make sure ’ something important , ? Not something unimportant… like defective intercom… something like . Okay ? Captain Wren wants say subject. ” “ Captain Piltchard ’ right , fellas , ” said Captain Wren . “ And ’ I ’ going say subject . Well , finally got Bologna today , found ’ milk run . We little nervous , I guess , ’ much damage . Well , listen . Colonel Cathcart got permission us go back . And tomorrow ’ really going paste ammunition dumps . Now , think ? ” And prove Yossarian bore animosity , even assigned fly lead bombardier McWatt first formation went back Bologna next day . He came target like Havermeyer , confidently taking evasive action , suddenly shooting living shit ! Heavy flak everywhere ! He lulled , lured trapped , nothing could sit like idiot watch ugly black puffs smashing kill . There nothing could bombs dropped look back bombsight , fine cross-hairs lens glued magnetically target exactly placed , intersecting perfectly deep inside yard block camouflaged warehouses base first building . He trembling steadily plane crept ahead . He could hear hollow boom-boom-boom-boom flak pounding around overlapping measures four , sharp , piercing crack ! single shell exploding suddenly close . His head bursting thousand dissonant impulses prayed bombs drop . He wanted sob . The engines droned monotonously like fat , lazy fly . At last indices bombsight crossed , tripping away eight 500-pounders one . The plane lurched upward buoyantly lightened load . Yossarian bent away bombsight crookedly watch indicator left . When pointer touched zero , closed bomb bay doors , intercom , top voice , shrieked : “ Turn right hard ! ” McWatt responded instantly . With grinding howl engines , flipped plane one wing wrung around remorselessly screaming turn away twin spires flak Yossarian spied stabbing toward . Then Yossarian McWatt climb keep climbing higher higher tore free finally calm , diamond-blue sky sunny pure everywhere laced distance long white veils tenuous fluff . The wind strummed soothingly cylindrical panes windows , relaxed exultantly picked speed turned McWatt left plunged right back , noticing transitory spasm elation mushrooming clusters flak leaping open high back shoulder right , exactly could turned left dived . He leveled McWatt another harsh cry whipped upward around ragged blue patch unpolluted air bombs dropped began strike . The first one fell yard , exactly aimed , rest bombs plane planes flight burst open ground charge rapid orange flashes across tops buildings , collapsed instantly vast , churning wave pink gray coal-black smoke went rolling turbulently directions quaked convulsively bowels though great blasts red white golden sheet lightning . “ Well , look , ” Aarfy marveled sonorously right beside Yossarian , plump , orbicular face sparkling look bright enchantment . “ There must ammunition dump there. ” Yossarian forgotten Aarfy . “ Get ! ” shouted . “ Get nose ! ” Aarfy smiled politely pointed toward target generous invitation Yossarian look . Yossarian began slapping insistently signaled wildly toward entrance crawlway . “ Get back ship ! ” cried frantically . “ Get back ship ! ” Aarfy shrugged amiably . “ I ’ hear , ” explained . Yossarian seized straps parachute harness pushed backward toward crawlway plane hit jarring concussion rattled bones made heart stop . He knew dead . “ Climb ! ” screamed intercom McWatt saw still alive . “ Climb , bastard ! Climb , climb , climb , climb ! ” The plane zoomed upward climb swift straining , leveled another harsh shout McWatt wrenched around roaring , merciless forty-five-degree turn sucked insides one enervating sniff left floating fleshless mid-air leveled McWatt long enough hurl back around toward right screeching dive . Through endless blobs ghostly black smoke sped , hanging smut wafting smooth plexiglass nose ship like evil , damp , sooty vapor cheeks . His heart hammering aching terror hurtled upward downward blind gangs flak charging murderously sky , sagging inertly . Sweat gushed neck torrents poured chest waist feeling warm slime . He vaguely aware instant planes formation longer , aware . His throat hurt like raw slash strangling intensity shrieked command McWatt . The engines rose deafening , agonized , ululating bellow time McWatt changed direction . And far front bursts flak still swarming sky new batteries guns poking around accurate altitude waited sadistically fly range . The plane slammed suddenly another loud , jarring explosion almost rocked back , nose filled immediately sweet clouds blue smoke . Something fire ! Yossarian whirled escape smacked Aarfy , struck match placidly lighting pipe . Yossarian gaped grinning , moon-faced navigator utter shock confusion . It occurred one mad . “ Jesus Christ ! ” screamed Aarfy tortured amazement . “ Get hell nose ! Are crazy ? Get ! ” “ What ? ” said Aarfy . “ Get ! ” Yossarian yelled hysterically , began clubbing Aarfy backhanded fists drive away . “ Get ! ” “ I still ’ hear , ” Aarfy called back innocently expression mild reproving perplexity . “ You ’ talk little louder. ” “ Get nose ! ” Yossarian shrieked frustration . “ They ’ trying kill us ! Don ’ understand ? They ’ trying kill us ! ” “ Which way I go , goddam ? ” McWatt shouted furiously intercom suffering , high-pitched voice . “ Which way I go ? ” “ Turn left ! Left , goddam dirty son bitch ! Turn left hard ! ” Aarfy crept close behind Yossarian jabbed sharply ribs stem pipe . Yossarian flew toward ceiling whinnying cry , jumped completely around knees , white sheet quivering rage . Aarfy winked encouragingly jerked thumb back toward McWatt humorous moue . “ What ’ eating ? ” asked laugh . Yossarian struck weird sense distortion . “ Will get ? ” yelped beseechingly , shoved Aarfy strength . “ Are deaf something ? Get back plane ! ” And McWatt screamed , “ Dive ! Dive ! ” Down sank crunching , thudding , voluminous barrage bursting antiaircraft shells Aarfy came creeping back behind Yossarian jabbed sharply ribs . Yossarian shied upward another whinnying gasp . “ I still ’ hear , ” Aarfy said . “ I said get ! ” Yossarian shouted , broke tears . He began punching Aarfy body hands hard could . “ Get away ! Get away ! ” Punching Aarfy like sinking fists limp sack inflated rubber . There resistance , response soft , insensitive mass , Yossarian ’ spirit died arms dropped helplessly exhaustion . He overcome humiliating feeling impotence ready weep self-pity . “ What say ? ” Aarfy asked . “ Get away , ” Yossarian answered , pleading . “ Go back plane. ” “ I still ’ hear you. ” “ Never mind , ” wailed Yossarian , “ never mind . Just leave alone. ” “ Never mind ? ” Yossarian began hitting forehead . He seized Aarfy shirt front , struggling feet traction , dragged rear nose compartment flung like bloated unwieldy bag entrance crawlway . A shell banged open stupendous clout right beside ear scrambling back toward front , undestroyed recess intelligence wondered kill . They climbing . The engines howling though pain , air inside plane acrid smell machinery fetid stench gasoline . The next thing knew , snowing ! Thousands tiny bits white paper falling like snowflakes inside plane , milling around head thickly clung eyelashes blinked astonishment fluttered nostrils lips time inhaled . When spun around bewilderment , Aarfy grinning proudly ear ear like something inhuman held shattered paper map Yossarian see . A large chunk flak ripped floor Aarfy ’ colossal jumble maps ripped ceiling inches away heads . Aarfy ’ joy sublime . “ Will look ? ” murmured , waggling two stubby fingers playfully Yossarian ’ face hole one maps . “ Will look ? ” Yossarian dumbfounded state rapturous contentment . Aarfy like eerie ogre dream , incapable bruised evaded , Yossarian dreaded complex reasons petrified untangle . Wind whistling jagged gash floor kept myriad bits paper circulating like alabaster particles paperweight contributed sensation lacquered , waterlogged unreality . Everything seemed strange , tawdry grotesque . His head throbbing shrill clamor drilled relentlessly ears . It McWatt , begging directions incoherent frenzy . Yossarian continued staring tormented fascination Aarfy ’ spherical countenance beaming serenely vacantly drifting whorls white paper bits concluded raving lunatic eight bursts flak broke open successively eye level right , eight , eight , last group pulled toward left almost directly front . “ Turn left hard ! ” hollered McWatt , Aarfy kept grinning , McWatt turn left hard , flak turned left hard , catching fast , Yossarian hollered , “ I said hard , hard , hard , hard , bastard , hard ! ” And McWatt bent plane around even harder still , suddenly , miraculously , range . The flak ended . The guns stopped booming . And alive . Behind , men dying . Strung miles stricken , tortuous , squirming line , flights planes making hazardous journey target , threading swift way swollen masses new old bursts flak like rats racing pack droppings . One fire , flapped lamely , billowing gigantically like monstrous blood-red star . As Yossarian watched , burning plane floated side began spiraling slowly wide , tremulous , narrowing circles , huge flaming burden blazing orange flaring back like long , swirling cape fire smoke . There parachutes , one , two , three… four , plane gyrated spin fell rest way ground , fluttering insensibly inside vivid pyre like shred colored tissue paper . One whole flight planes another squadron blasted apart . Yossarian sighed barrenly , day ’ work done . He listless sticky . The engines crooned mellifluously McWatt throttled back loiter allow rest planes flight catch . The abrupt stillness seemed alien artificial , little insidious . Yossarian unsnapped flak suit took helmet . He sighed , restlessly , closed eyes tried relax . “ Where ’ Orr ? ” someone asked suddenly intercom . Yossarian bounded one-syllable cry crackled anxiety provided rational explanation whole mysterious phenomenon flak Bologna : Orr ! He lunged forward bombsight search downward plexiglass reassuring sign Orr , drew flak like magnet undoubtedly attracted crack batteries whole Hermann Goering Division Bologna overnight wherever hell stationed day Orr still Rome . Aarfy launched forward instant later cracked Yossarian bridge nose sharp rim flak helmet . Yossarian cursed eyes flooded tears . “ There , ” Aarfy orated funereally , pointing dramatically hay wagon two horses standing barn gray stone farmhouse . “ Smashed bits . I guess numbers up. ” Yossarian swore Aarfy continued searching intently , cold compassionate kind fear little bouncy bizarre buck-toothed tentmate smashed Appleby ’ forehead open ping-pong racket scaring daylights Yossarian . At last Yossarian spotted two-engined , twin-ruddered plane flew green background forests field yellow farmland . One propellers feathered perfectly still , plane maintaining altitude holding proper course . Yossarian muttered unconscious prayer thankfulness flared Orr savagely ranting fusion resentment relief . “ That bastard ! ” began . “ That goddam stunted , red-faced , big-cheeked , curly-headed , buck-toothed rat bastard son bitch ! ” “ What ? ” said Aarfy . “ That dirty goddam midget-assed , apple-cheeked , goggle-eyed , undersized , buck-toothed , grinning , crazy sonofabitchin-bastard ! ” Yossarian sputtered . “ What ? ” “ Never mind ! ” “ I still ’ hear , ” Aarfy answered . Yossarian swung around methodically face Aarfy . “ You prick , ” began . “ Me ? ” “ You pompous , rotund , neighborly , vacuous , complacent… ” Aarfy unperturbed . Calmly struck wooden match sucked noisily pipe eloquent air benign magnanimous forgiveness . He smiled sociably opened mouth speak . Yossarian put hand Aarfy ’ mouth pushed away wearily . He shut eyes pretended sleep way back field would listen Aarfy see . At briefing room Yossarian made intelligence report Captain Black waited muttering suspense others Orr chugged sight overhead finally one good engine still keeping aloft gamely . Nobody breathed . Orr ’ landing gear would come . Yossarian hung around Orr crash-landed safely , stole first jeep could find key ignition raced back tent begin packing feverishly emergency rest leave decided take Rome , found Luciana invisible scar night . 16 LUCIANA He found Luciana sitting alone table Allied officers ’ night club , drunken Anzac major brought stupid enough desert ribald company singing comrades bar . “ All right , I ’ dance , ” said , Yossarian could even speak . “ But I ’ let sleep me. ” “ Who asked ? ” Yossarian asked . “ You ’ want sleep ? ” exclaimed surprise . “ I ’ want dance you. ” She seized Yossarian ’ hand pulled dance floor . She worse dancer even , threw synthetic jitterbug music uninhibited pleasure ever observed felt legs falling asleep boredom yanked dance floor toward table girl screwing still sitting tipsily one hand around Aarfy ’ neck , orange satin blouse still hanging open slovenly full white lacy brassière made dirty sex talk ostentatiously Huple , Orr , Kid Sampson Hungry Joe .

The food elegant expensive , aisles overflowing great streams flushed merry proprietors , stout balding . The bustling interior radiated enormous , engulfing waves fun warmth . Yossarian got tremendous kick rude gusto Luciana ignored completely shoveled away whole meal hands . She ate like horse last plate clean , placed silverware air conclusion settled back lazily chair dreamy congested look sated gluttony . She drew deep , smiling , contented breath regarded amorously melting gaze . “ Okay , Joe , ” purred , glowing dark eyes drowsy grateful . “ Now I let sleep me. ” “ My name Yossarian. ” “ Okay , Yossarian , ” answered soft repentant laugh . “ Now I let sleep me. ” “ Who asked ? ” said Yossarian .

But I let write live . And tomorrow morning I come room ficky-fick I go work French office . Capisci ? ” “ Bullshit ! ” Yossarian exclaimed angry disappointment . “ Cosa vuol dire bullshit ? ” Luciana inquired blank look . Yossarian broke loud laughter . He answered finally tone sympathetic good humor . “ It means I want escort wherever hell I take next I rush back night club Aarfy leaves wonderful tomato ’ got without giving chance ask aunt friend must ’ like her. ” “ Come ? ” “ Subito , subito , ” taunted tenderly . “ Mamma waiting . Remember ? ” “ Si , si . Mamma. ” Yossarian let girl drag lovely Roman spring night almost mile reached chaotic bus depot honking horns , blazing red yellow lights echoing snarling vituperations unshaven bus drivers pouring loathsome , hair-raising curses , passengers strolling , unconcerned knots pedestrians clogging paths , ignored bumped buses began shouting curses back . Luciana vanished aboard one diminutive green vehicles , Yossarian hurried fast could way back cabaret bleary-eyed bleached blonde open orange satin blouse .

They doted kittenishly Nately deferred passively Aarfy , thought Yossarian crazy recoiled distasteful contempt time made indecent proposal tried fondle passed stairs . They superb creatures pulpy , bright , pointed tongues mouths like round warm plums , little sweet sticky , little rotten . They class ; Yossarian sure class , knew , knew , . He could picture , walked , kind underclothing wore svelte feminine parts , filmy , smooth , clinging garments deepest black opalescent pastel radiance flowering lace borders fragrant tantalizing fumes pampered flesh scented bath salts rising germinating cloud blue-white breasts . He wished Aarfy , making obscene , brutal , cheerful love juicy drunken tart ’ give tinker ’ dam would never think . But Aarfy already back apartment Yossarian arrived , Yossarian gaped sense persecuted astonishment suffered morning Bologna malign cabalistic irremovable presence nose plane . “ What ? ” asked . “ That ’ right , ask ! ” Hungry Joe exclaimed rage . “ Make tell ’ ! ” With long , theatrical moan , Kid Sampson made pistol thumb forefinger blew brains . Huple , chewing away bulging wad bubble gum , drank everything callow , vacant expression fifteen-year old face . Aarfy tapping bowl pipe palm leisurely paced back forth corpulent self-approval , obviously delighted stir causing . “ Didn ’ go home girl ? ” Yossarian demanded . “ Oh , sure , I went home , ” Aarfy replied . “ You ’ think I going let try find way home alone , ? ” “ Wouldn ’ let stay ? ” “ Oh , wanted stay , right. ” Aarfy chuckled . “ Don ’ worry good old Aarfy .

They bounced stairs great roistering clatter , laughing loud breathlessly knocking hilarious heads together time paused rest . Near bottom met Nately coming stopped laughing . Nately drawn , dirty unhappy . His tie twisted shirt rumpled , walked hands pockets .

Luciana touched Nately ’ forlorn air , broke loudly robust laughter moment stepped outside sunny street Yossarian heard Hungry Joe beseeching window come back take clothes , really photographer Life magazine . Luciana fled mirthfully along sidewalk high white wedgies , pulling Yossarian along tow lusty ingenuous zeal displayed dance hall night every moment since . Yossarian caught walked arm around waist came corner stepped away . She straightened hair mirror pocketbook put lipstick . “ Why ’ ask let write name address piece paper able find come Rome ? ” suggested . “ Why ’ let write name address piece paper ? ” agreed . “ Why ? ” demanded belligerently , mouth curling suddenly vehement sneer eyes flashing anger . “ So tear little pieces soon I leave ? ” “ Who ’ going tear ? ” Yossarian protested confusion . “ What hell talking ? ” “ You , ” insisted . “ You ’ tear little pieces minute I ’ gone go walking away like big shot tall , young , beautiful girl like , Luciana , let sleep ask money. ” “ How much money asking ? ” asked . “ Stupido ! ” shouted emotion . “ I asking money ! ” She stamped foot raised arm turbulent gesture made Yossarian fear going crack face great pocketbook . Instead , scribbled name address slip paper thrust . “ Here , ” taunted sardonically , biting lip still delicate tremor . “ Don ’ forget . Don ’ forget tear tiny pieces soon I gone. ” Then smiled serenely , squeezed hand , whispered regretful “ Addio , ” pressed moment straightened walked away unconscious dignity grace . The minute gone , Yossarian tore slip paper walked away direction , feeling much like big shot beautiful young girl like Luciana slept ask money . He pretty pleased looked dining room Red Cross building found eating breakfast dozens dozens servicemen kinds fantastic uniforms , surrounded images Luciana getting clothes clothes caressing haranguing tempestuously pink rayon chemise wore bed would take . Yossarian choked toast eggs enormity error tearing long , lithe , nude , young vibrant limbs pieces paper impudently dumping smugly gutter curb . He missed terribly already . There many strident faceless people uniform dining room . He felt urgent desire alone soon sprang impetuously table went running outside back street toward apartment search tiny bits paper gutter , flushed away street cleaner ’ hose . He ’ find Allied officers ’ night club evening sweltering , burnished , hedonistic bedlam black-market restaurant vast bobbing wooden trays elegant food chirping flock bright lovely girls . He ’ even find restaurant . When went bed alone , dodged flak Bologna dream , Aarfy hanging shoulder abominably plane bloated sordid leer . In morning ran looking Luciana French offices could find , nobody knew talking , ran terror , jumpy , distraught disorganized keep running terror somewhere , enlisted men ’ apartment squat maid lime-colored panties , found dusting Snowden ’ room fifth floor drab brown sweater heavy dark skirt . Snowden still alive , Yossarian could tell Snowden ’ room name stenciled white blue duffel bag tripped plunged doorway frenzy creative desperation . The woman caught wrists could fall came stumbling toward need pulled along top flopped backward onto bed enveloped hospitably flaccid consoling embrace , dust mop aloft hand like banner broad , brutish congenial face gazed fondly smile unperjured friendship . There sharp elastic snap rolled lime-colored panties beneath without disturbing . He stuffed money hand finished . She hugged gratitude . He hugged . She hugged back pulled top bed . He stuffed money hand finished time ran room could begin hugging gratitude . Back apartment , threw things together fast could , left Nately money , ran back Pianosa supply plane apologize Hungry Joe shutting bedroom . The apology unnecessary , Hungry Joe high spirits Yossarian found . Hungry Joe grinning ear ear , Yossarian turned sick sight , understood instantly high spirits meant . “ Forty missions , ” Hungry Joe announced readily voice lyrical relief elation . “ The colonel raised again. ” Yossarian stunned . “ But I ’ got thirty-two , goddammit ! Three I would through. ” Hungry Joe shrugged indifferently . “ The colonel wants forty missions , ” repeated . Yossarian shoved way ran right hospital . 17 THE SOLDIER IN WHITE Yossarian ran right hospital , determined remain forever rather fly one mission thirty-two missions . Ten days changed mind came , colonel raised missions forty-five Yossarian ran right back , determined remain hospital forever rather fly one mission six missions flown . Yossarian could run hospital whenever wanted liver eyes ; doctors ’ fix liver condition ’ meet eyes time told liver condition . He could enjoy hospital , long one really sick ward . His system sturdy enough survive case someone else ’ malaria influenza scarcely discomfort . He could come people ’ tonsillectomies without suffering postoperative distress , even endure hernias hemorrhoids mild nausea revulsion . But much could go without getting sick . After ready bolt . He could relax hospital , since one expected anything . All expected hospital die get better , since perfectly right begin , getting better easy . Being hospital better Bologna flying Avignon Huple Dobbs controls Snowden dying back . There usually nearly many sick people inside hospital Yossarian saw outside hospital , generally fewer people inside hospital seriously sick . There much lower death rate inside hospital outside hospital , much healthier death rate . Few people died unnecessarily . People knew lot dying inside hospital made much neater , orderly job . They ’ dominate Death inside hospital , certainly made behave . They taught manners . They ’ keep Death , act like lady . People gave ghost delicacy taste inside hospital . There none crude , ugly ostentation dying common outside hospital . They blow mid-air like Kraft dead man Yossarian ’ tent , freeze death blazing summertime way Snowden frozen death spilling secret Yossarian back plane . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian tried comfort . “ There , there. ” They ’ take lam weirdly inside cloud way Clevinger done . They ’ explode blood clotted matter . They ’ drown get struck lightning , mangled machinery crushed landslides . They ’ get shot death hold-ups , strangled death rapes , stabbed death saloons , bludgeoned death axes parents children die summarily act God . Nobody choked death . People bled death like gentlemen operating room expired without comment oxygen tent . There none tricky now-you-see-me-now-you-don ’ business much vogue outside hospital , none now-I-am-and-now-I-ain ’ . There famines floods . Children ’ suffocate cradles iceboxes fall trucks . No one beaten death . People ’ stick heads ovens gas , jump front subway trains come plummeting like dead weights hotel windows whoosh ! , accelerating rate sixteen feet per second land hideous plop ! sidewalk die disgustingly public like alpaca sack full hairy strawberry ice cream , bleeding , pink toes awry . All things considered , Yossarian often preferred hospital , even though faults . The help tended officious , rules , heeded , restrictive , management meddlesome . Since sick people apt present , could always depend lively young crowd ward , entertainment always good . He forced admit hospitals altered steadily worse war continued one moved closer battlefront , deterioration quality guests becoming marked within combat zone effects booming wartime conditions apt make conspicuous immediately . The people got sicker sicker deeper moved combat , finally hospital last time soldier white , could sicker without dead , soon . The soldier white constructed entirely gauze , plaster thermometer , thermometer merely adornment left balanced empty dark hole bandages mouth early morning late afternoon Nurse Cramer Nurse Duckett right afternoon Nurse Cramer read thermometer discovered dead . Now Yossarian looked back , seemed Nurse Cramer , rather talkative Texan , murdered soldier white ; read thermometer reported found , soldier white might still lying alive exactly lying along , encased head toe plaster gauze strange , rigid legs elevated hips strange arms strung perpendicularly , four bulky limbs casts , four strange , useless limbs hoisted air taut wire cables fantastically long lead weights suspended darkly . Lying way might much life , life , decision terminate , Yossarian felt , hardly Nurse Cramer ’ . The soldier white like unrolled bandage hole like broken block stone harbor crooked zinc pipe jutting . The patients ward , Texan , shrank tenderhearted aversion moment set eyes morning night sneaked . They gathered soberly farthest recess ward gossiped malicious , offended undertones , rebelling presence ghastly imposition resenting malevolently nauseating truth bright reminder . They shared common dread would begin moaning . “ I ’ know I ’ begin moaning , ” dashing young fighter pilot golden mustache grieved forlornly . “ It means ’ moan night , , ’ able tell time. ” No sound came soldier white time . The ragged round hole mouth deep jet black showed sign lip , teeth , palate tongue . The one ever came close enough look affable Texan , came close enough several times day chat votes decent folk , opening conversation unvarying greeting : “ What say , fella ? How coming along ? ” The rest men avoided regulation maroon corduroy bathrobes unraveling flannel pajamas , wondering gloomily soldier white , really like inside . “ He ’ right , I tell , ” Texan would report back encouragingly social visits . “ Deep inside ’ really regular guy . He ’ feeling little shy insecure ’ know anybody ’ talk . Why ’ step right introduce ? He ’ hurt you. ” “ What goddam hell talking ? ” Dunbar demanded . “ Does even know ’ talking ? ” “ Sure knows I ’ talking . He ’ stupid . There ’ nothing wrong him. ” “ Can hear ? ” “ Well , I ’ know hear , I ’ sure knows I ’ talking about. ” “ Does hole mouth ever move ? ” “ Now , kind crazy question ? ” Texan asked uneasily . “ How tell ’ breathing never moves ? ” “ How tell ’ ? ” “ Does pads eyes underneath bandage face ? ” “ Does ever wiggle toes move tips fingers ? ” The Texan backed away mounting confusion . “ Now , kind crazy question ? You fellas must crazy something . Why ’ walk right get acquainted ? He ’ real nice guy , I tell you. ” The soldier white like stuffed sterilized mummy real nice guy . Nurse Duckett Nurse Cramer kept spick-and-span . They brushed bandages often whiskbroom scrubbed plaster casts arms , legs , shoulders , chest pelvis soapy water . Working round tin metal polish , waxed dim gloss dull zinc pipe rising cement groin . With damp dish towels wiped dust several times day slim black rubber tubes leading two large stoppered jars , one , hanging post beside bed , dripping fluid arm constantly slit bandages , almost sight floor , drained fluid away zinc pipe rising groin . Both young nurses polished glass jars unceasingly . They proud housework . The solicitous two Nurse Cramer , shapely , pretty , sexless girl wholesome unattractive face . Nurse Cramer cute nose radiant , blooming complexion dotted fetching sprays adorable freckles Yossarian detested . She touched deeply soldier white . Her virtuous , pale-blue , saucerlike eyes flooded leviathan tears unexpected occasions made Yossarian mad . “ How hell know ’ even ? ” asked . “ Don ’ dare talk way ! ” replied indignantly . “ Well , ? You ’ even know ’ really him. ” “ Who ? ” “ Whoever ’ supposed bandages . You might really weeping somebody else . How know ’ even alive ? ” “ What terrible thing say ! ” Nurse Cramer exclaimed . “ Now , get right bed stop making jokes him. ” “ I ’ making jokes . Anybody might . For know , might even Mudd. ” “ What talking ? ” Nurse Cramer pleaded quavering voice . “ Maybe ’ dead man is. ” “ What dead man ? ” “ I ’ got dead man tent nobody throw . His name Mudd. ” Nurse Cramer ’ face blanched turned Dunbar desperately aid . “ Make stop saying things like , ” begged . “ Maybe ’ one inside , ” Dunbar suggested helpfully . “ Maybe sent bandages joke. ” She stepped away Dunbar alarm . “ You ’ crazy , ” cried , glancing imploringly . “ You ’ crazy. ” Nurse Duckett showed chased back beds Nurse Cramer changed stoppered jars soldier white . Changing jars soldier white trouble , since clear fluid dripped back inside apparent loss . When jar feeding inside elbow empty , jar floor full , two simply uncoupled respective hoses reversed quickly liquid could dripped right back . Changing jars trouble anyone men watched changed every hour baffled procedure . “ Why ’ hook two jars eliminate middleman ? ” artillery captain Yossarian stopped playing chess inquired . “ What hell need ? ” “ I wonder deserve , ” warrant officer malaria mosquito bite ass lamented Nurse Cramer read thermometer discovered soldier white dead . “ He went war , ” fighter pilot golden mustache surmised . “ We went war , ” Dunbar countered . “ That ’ I mean , ” warrant officer malaria continued . “ Why ? There ’ seem logic system rewards punishment . Look happened . If I gotten syphilis dose clap five minutes passion beach instead damned mosquito bite , I could see justice . But malaria ? Malaria ? Who explain malaria consequence fornication ? ” The warrant officer shook head numb astonishment . “ What ? ” Yossarian said . “ I stepped tent Marrakech one night get bar candy caught dose clap Wac I never even saw hissed bushes . All I really wanted bar candy , could turn ? ” “ That sounds like dose clap , right , ” warrant officer agreed . “ But I ’ still got somebody else ’ malaria . Just I ’ like see things sort straightened , person getting exactly deserves . It might give confidence universe. ” “ I ’ got somebody else ’ three hundred thousand dollars , ” dashing young fighter captain golden mustache admitted . “ I ’ goofing since day I born . I cheated way prep school college , I ’ ever since shacking pretty girls think I ’ make good husband . I ’ got ambition . The thing I want war marry girl ’ got money I shack lots pretty girls . The three hundred thousand bucks left I born grandfather made fortune selling international scale . I know I ’ deserve , I ’ damned I give back . I wonder really belongs to. ” “ Maybe belongs father , ” Dunbar conjectured . “ He spent lifetime hard work never could make enough money even send sister college . He ’ dead , might well keep it. ” “ Now , find malaria belongs ’ set . It ’ I ’ got anything malaria . I ’ soon goldbrick malaria anything else . It ’ I feel injustice committed . Why I somebody else ’ malaria dose clap ? ” “ I ’ got dose clap , ” Yossarian told . “ I ’ got keep flying combat missions dose kill me. ” “ That makes even worse . What ’ justice ? ” “ I friend named Clevinger two half weeks ago used see plenty justice it. ” “ It ’ highest kind justice , ” Clevinger gloated , clapping hands merry laugh . “ I ’ help thinking Hippolytus Euripides , early licentiousness Theseus probably responsible asceticism son helps bring tragedy ruins . If nothing else , episode Wac teach evil sexual immorality. ” “ It teaches evil candy. ” “ Can ’ see ’ exactly without blame predicament ’ ? ” Clevinger continued undisguised relish . “ If ’ laid hospital venereal disease ten days back Africa , might finished twenty-five missions time sent home Colonel Nevers killed Colonel Cathcart came replace him. ” “ And ? ” Yossarian replied . “ You never got clap Marrakech ’ predicament. ” “ I ’ know , ” confessed Clevinger , trace mock concern . “ I guess I must done something bad time. ” “ Do really believe ? ” Clevinger laughed . “ No , course . I like kid along little. ” There many dangers Yossarian keep track . There Hitler , Mussolini Tojo , example , kill . There Lieutenant Scheisskopf fanaticism parades bloated colonel big fat mustache fanaticism retribution , wanted kill , . There Appleby , Havermeyer , Black Korn . There Nurse Cramer Nurse Duckett , almost certain wanted dead , Texan C.I.D . man , doubt . There bartenders , bricklayers bus conductors world wanted dead , landlords tenants , traitors patriots , lynchers , leeches lackeys , bump . That secret Snowden spilled mission Avignon-they get ; Snowden spilled back plane . There lymph glands might . There kidneys , nerve sheaths corpuscles . There tumors brain . There Hodgkin ’ disease , leukemia , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . There fertile red meadows epithelial tissue catch coddle cancer cell . There diseases skin , diseases bone , diseases lung , diseases stomach , diseases heart , blood arteries . There diseases head , diseases neck , diseases chest , diseases intestines , diseases crotch . There even diseases feet . There billions conscientious body cells oxidating away day night like dumb animals complicated job keeping alive healthy , every one potential traitor foe . There many diseases took truly diseased mind even think often Hungry Joe . Hungry Joe collected lists fatal diseases arranged alphabetical order could put finger without delay one wanted worry . He grew upset whenever misplaced could add list , would go rushing cold sweat Doc Daneeka help . “ Give Ewing ’ tumor , ” Yossarian advised Doc Daneeka , would come Yossarian help handling Hungry Joe , “ follow melanoma . Hungry Joe likes lingering diseases , likes fulminating ones even more. ” Doc Daneeka never heard either . “ How manage keep many diseases like ? ” inquired high professional esteem . “ I learn hospital I study Reader ’ Digest. ” Yossarian many ailments afraid sometimes tempted turn hospital good spend rest life stretched inside oxygen tent battery specialists nurses seated one side bed twenty-four hours day waiting something go wrong least one surgeon knife poised , ready jump forward begin cutting away moment became necessary . Aneurisms , instance ; else could ever defend time aneurism aorta ? Yossarian felt much safer inside hospital outside hospital , even though loathed surgeon knife much ever loathed anyone . He could start screaming inside hospital people would least come running try help ; outside hospital would throw prison ever started screaming things felt everyone ought start screaming , would put hospital . One things wanted start screaming surgeon ’ knife almost certain waiting everyone else lived long enough die . He wondered often would ever recognize first chill , flush , twinge , ache , belch , sneeze , stain , lethargy , vocal slip , loss balance lapse memory would signal inevitable beginning inevitable end . He afraid also Doc Daneeka would still refuse help went jumping Major Major ’ office , right . “ You think ’ got something afraid ? ” Doc Daneeka demanded , lifting delicate immaculate dark head chest gaze Yossarian irascibly moment lachrymose eyes . “ What ? My precious medical skills rusting away lousy island doctors cleaning . Do think I enjoy sitting day day refusing help ? I ’ mind much I could refuse help back States place like Rome . But saying ’ easy , either. ” “ Then stop saying . Ground me. ” “ I ’ ground , ” Doc Daneeka mumbled . “ How many times told ? ” “ Yes . Major Major told ’ one squadron ground me. ” Doc Daneeka stunned . “ Major Major told ? When ? ” “ When I tackled ditch. ” “ Major Major told ? In ditch ? ” “ He told office left ditch jumped inside . He told tell anyone told , ’ start shooting mouth off. ” “ Why dirty , scheming liar ! ” Doc Daneeka cried . “ He ’ supposed tell anyone . Did tell I could ground ? ” “ Just filling little slip paper saying I ’ verge nervous collapse sending Group . Dr. Stubbs grounds men squadron time , ’ ? ” “ And happens men Stubbs ground ? ” Doc Daneeka retorted sneer . “ They go right back combat status , ’ ? And finds right creek . Sure , I ground filling slip saying ’ unfit fly . But ’ catch. ” “ Catch-22 ? ” “ Sure . If I take combat duty , Group approve action , Group ’ going . They ’ put right back combat status , I ? On way Pacific Ocean , probably . No , thank . I ’ going take chances you. ” “ Isn ’ worth try ? ” Yossarian argued . “ What ’ hot Pianosa ? ” “ Pianosa terrible . But ’ better Pacific Ocean . I ’ mind shipped someplace civilized I might pick buck two abortion money every . But ’ got Pacific jungles monsoons , I ’ rot there. ” “ You ’ rotting here. ” Doc Daneeka flared angrily . “ Yeah ? Well , least I ’ going come war alive , lot ’ going do. ” “ That ’ I ’ trying tell , goddammit . I ’ asking save life. ” “ It ’ business save lives , ” Doc Daneeka retorted sullenly . “ What business ? ” “ I ’ know business . All ever told uphold ethics profession never give testimony another physician . Listen . You think ’ one whose life danger ? What ? Those two quacks I ’ got working medical tent still ’ find ’ wrong me. ” “ Maybe ’ Ewing ’ tumor , ” Yossarian muttered sarcastically . “ Do really think ? ” Doc Daneeka exclaimed fright . “ Oh , I ’ know , ” Yossarian answered impatiently . “ I know I ’ going fly missions . They ’ really shoot , would ? I ’ got fifty-one. ” “ Why ’ least finish fifty-five take stand ? ” Doc Daneeka advised . “ With bitching , ’ never finished tour duty even once. ” “ How hell I ? The colonel keeps raising every time I get close. ” “ You never finish missions keep running hospital going Rome . You ’ much , stronger position fifty-five finished refused fly . Then maybe I ’ see I could do. ” “ Do promise ? ” “ I promise. ” “ What promise ? ” “ I promise maybe I ’ think something help finish fifty-five missions get McWatt put name flight log I draw flight pay without going plane . I ’ afraid airplanes . Did read airplane crash Idaho three weeks ago ? Six people killed . It terrible . I ’ know want put four hours ’ flight time every month order get flight pay . Don ’ I enough worry without worrying killed airplane crash ? ” “ I worry airplane crashes also , ” Yossarian told . “ You ’ one. ” “ Yeah , I ’ also pretty worried Ewing ’ tumor , ” Doc Daneeka boasted . “ Do think ’ nose stuffed time I always feel chilly ? Take pulse. ” Yossarian also worried Ewing ’ tumor melanoma . Catastrophes lurking everywhere , numerous count . When contemplated many diseases potential accidents threatening , positively astounded managed survive good health long . It miraculous . Each day faced another dangerous mission mortality . And surviving twenty-eight years . 18 THE SOLDIER WHO SAW EVERYTHING TWICE Yossarian owed good health exercise , fresh air , teamwork good sportsmanship ; get away first discovered hospital . When physical-education officer Lowery Field ordered everyone fall calisthenics one afternoon , Yossarian , private , reported instead dispensary said pain right side . “ Beat , ” said doctor duty , crossword puzzle . “ We ’ tell beat , ” said corporal . “ There ’ new directive abdominal complaints . We keep observation five days many dying make beat it. ” “ All right , ” grumbled doctor . “ Keep observation five days make beat it. ” They took Yossarian ’ clothes away put ward , happy one snoring nearby . In morning helpful young English intern popped ask liver . “ I think ’ appendix ’ bothering , ” Yossarian told . “ Your appendix good , ” Englishman declared jaunty authority . “ If appendix goes wrong , take back active duty almost time . But come us liver complaint fool us weeks . The liver , see , large , ugly mystery us . If ’ ever eaten liver know I mean . We ’ pretty sure today liver exists fairly good idea whenever ’ ’ supposed . Beyond , ’ really dark . After , liver ? My father , example , died cancer liver never sick day life right till moment killed . Never felt twinge pain . In way , bad , since I hated father . Lust mother , know. ” “ What ’ English medical officer duty ? ” Yossarian wanted know . The officer laughed . “ I ’ tell I see tomorrow morning . And throw silly ice bag away die pneumonia. ” Yossarian never saw . That one nice things doctors hospital ; never saw second time . They came went simply disappeared . In place English intern next day , arrived group doctors never seen ask appendix . “ There ’ nothing wrong appendix , ” Yossarian informed . “ The doctor yesterday said liver. ” “ Maybe liver , ” replied white-haired officer charge . “ What blood count show ? ” “ He ’ blood count. ” “ Have one taken right away . We ’ afford take chances patient condition . We ’ got keep covered case dies. ” He made notation clipboard spoke Yossarian . “ In meantime , keep ice bag . It ’ important. ” “ I ’ ice bag on. ” “ Well , get one . There must ice bag around somewhere . And let someone know pain becomes unendurable. ” At end ten days , new group doctors came Yossarian bad news ; perfect health get . He rescued nick time patient across aisle began see everything twice . Without warning , patient sat bed shouted . “ I see everything twice ! ” A nurse screamed orderly fainted . Doctors came running every direction needles , lights , tubes , rubber mallets oscillating metal tines . They rolled complicated instruments wheels . There enough patient go around , specialists pushed forward line raw tempers snapped colleagues front hurry give somebody else chance . A colonel large forehead horn-rimmed glasses soon arrived diagnosis . “ It ’ meningitis , ” called emphatically , waving others back . “ Although Lord knows ’ slightest reason thinking so. ” “ Then pick meningitis ? ” inquired major suave chuckle . “ Why , let ’ say , acute nephritis ? ” “ Because I ’ meningitis man , ’ , acute-nephritis man , ” retorted colonel . “ And I ’ going give kidney birds without struggle . I first. ” In end , doctors accord . They agreed idea wrong soldier saw everything twice , rolled away room corridor quarantined everyone else ward fourteen days . Thanksgiving Day came went without fuss Yossarian still hospital . The bad thing turkey dinner , even pretty good . It rational Thanksgiving ever spent , took sacred oath spend every future Thanksgiving Day cloistered shelter hospital . He broke sacred oath next year , spent holiday hotel room instead intellectual conversation Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife , Dori Duz ’ dog tags occasion henpecked Yossarian sententiously cynical callous Thanksgiving , even though ’ believe God much ’ . “ I ’ probably good atheist , ” speculated boastfully . “ But even I feel great deal thankful ’ ashamed show it. ” “ Name one thing I ’ got thankful , ” Yossarian challenged without interest . “ Well… ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife mused paused moment ponder dubiously . “ Me. ” “ Oh , come , ” scoffed . She arched eyebrows surprise . “ Aren ’ thankful ? ” asked . She frowned peevishly , pride wounded . “ I ’ shack , know , ” told cold dignity . “ My husband whole squadron full aviation cadets would happy shack commanding officer ’ wife added fillip would give them. ” Yossarian decided change subject . “ Now ’ changing subject , ” pointed diplomatically . “ I ’ bet I name two things miserable every one name thankful for. ” “ Be thankful ’ got , ” insisted . “ I , honey . But I ’ also goddam good miserable I ’ Dori Duz , . Or hundreds girls women I ’ see want short lifetime ’ able go bed even once. ” “ Be thankful ’ healthy. ” “ Be bitter ’ going stay way. ” “ Be glad ’ even alive. ” “ Be furious ’ going die. ” “ Things could much worse , ” cried . “ They could one hell lot better , ” answered heatedly . “ You ’ naming one thing , ” protested . “ You said could name two. ” “ And ’ tell God works mysterious ways , ” Yossarian continued , hurtling objection . “ There ’ nothing mysterious . He ’ working . He ’ playing . Or else He ’ forgotten us . That ’ kind God people talk about-a country bumpkin , clumsy , bungling , brainless , conceited , uncouth hayseed . Good God , much reverence Supreme Being finds necessary include phenomena phlegm tooth decay His divine system creation ? What world running warped , evil , scatological mind His He robbed old people power control bowel movements ? Why world He ever create pain ? ” “ Pain ? ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife pounced upon word victoriously . “ Pain useful symptom . Pain warning us bodily dangers. ” “ And created dangers ? ” Yossarian demanded . He laughed caustically . “ Oh , He really charitable us He gave us pain ! Why ’ He used doorbell instead notify us , one His celestial choirs ? Or system blue-and-red neon tubes right middle person ’ forehead . Any jukebox manufacturer worth salt could done . Why ’ He ? ” “ People would certainly look silly walking around red neon tubes middle foreheads. ” “ They certainly look beautiful writhing agony stupefied morphine , ’ ? What colossal , immortal blunderer ! When consider opportunity power He really job , look stupid , ugly little mess He made instead , His sheer incompetence almost staggering . It ’ obvious He never met payroll . Why , self-respecting businessman would hire bungler like Him even shipping clerk ! ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife turned ashen disbelief ogling alarm . “ You ’ better talk way Him , honey , ” warned reprovingly low hostile voice . “ He might punish you. ” “ Isn ’ He punishing enough ? ” Yossarian snorted resentfully . “ You know , ’ let Him get away . Oh , , certainly ’ let Him get away scot free sorrow He ’ caused us . Someday I ’ going make Him pay . I know . On Judgment Day . Yes , That ’ day I ’ close enough reach grab little yokel His neck and- “ “ Stop ! Stop ! ” Lieutenant Scheisskopf ’ wife screamed suddenly , began beating ineffectually head fists . “ Stop ! ” Yossarian ducked behind arm protection slammed away feminine fury seconds , caught determinedly wrists forced gently back bed . “ What hell getting upset ? ” asked bewilderedly tone contrite amusement . “ I thought ’ believe God. ” “ I ’ , ” sobbed , bursting violently tears . “ But God I ’ believe good God , God , merciful God . He ’ mean stupid God make Him be. ” Yossarian laughed turned arms loose . “ Let ’ little religious freedom us , ” proposed obligingly . “ You ’ believe God want , I ’ believe God I want . Is deal ? ” That illogical Thanksgiving could ever remember spending , thoughts returned wishfully halcyon fourteen-day quarantine hospital year ; even idyll ended tragic note ; still good health quarantine period , told get go war . Yossarian sat bed heard bad news shouted . “ I see everything twice ! ” Pandemonium broke loose ward . The specialists came running directions ringed circle scrutiny confining could feel humid breath various noses blowing uncomfortably upon different sectors body . They went snooping eyes ears tiny beams light , assaulted legs feet rubber hammers vibrating forks , drew blood veins , held anything handy see periphery vision . The leader team doctors dignified , solicitous gentleman held one finger directly front Yossarian demanded , “ How many fingers see ? ” “ Two , ” said Yossarian . “ How many fingers see ? ” asked doctor , holding two . “ Two , ” said Yossarian . “ And many ? ” asked doctor , holding none . “ Two , ” said Yossarian . The doctor ’ face wreathed smile . “ By Jove , ’ right , ” declared jubilantly . “ He see everything twice. ” They rolled Yossarian away stretcher room soldier saw everything twice quarantined everyone else ward another fourteen days . “ I see everything twice ! ” soldier saw everything twice shouted rolled Yossarian . “ I see everything twice ! ” Yossarian shouted back loudly , secret wink . “ The walls ! The walls ! ” soldier cried . “ Move back walls ! ” “ The walls ! The walls ! ” Yossarian cried . “ Move back walls ! ” One doctors pretended shove wall back . “ Is far enough ? ” The soldier saw everything twice nodded weakly sank back bed . Yossarian nodded weakly , eying talented roommate great humility admiration . He knew presence master . His talented roommate obviously person studied emulated . During night , talented roommate died , Yossarian decided followed far enough . “ I see everything ! ” cried quickly . A new group specialists came pounding bedside instruments find true . “ How many fingers see ? ” asked leader , holding one . “ One. ” The doctor held two fingers . “ How many fingers see ? ” “ One. ” The doctor held ten fingers . “ And many ? ” “ One. ” The doctor turned doctors amazement . “ He see everything ! ” exclaimed . “ We made better. ” “ And time , , ” announced doctor Yossarian next found alone , tall , torpedo-shaped congenial man unshaven growth brown beard pack cigarettes shirt pocket chain-smoked insouciantly leaned wall . “ There relatives see . Oh , ’ worry , ” added laugh . “ Not relatives . It ’ mother , father brother chap died . They ’ traveled way New York see dying soldier , ’ handiest one ’ got. ” “ What talking ? ” Yossarian asked suspiciously . “ I ’ dying. ” “ Of course ’ dying . We ’ dying . Where devil else think ’ heading ? ” “ They ’ come see , ” Yossarian objected . “ They came see son. ” “ They ’ take get . As far ’ concerned , one dying boy good , bad . To scientist , dying boys equal . I proposition . You let come look minutes I ’ tell anyone ’ lying liver symptoms. ” Yossarian drew back farther . “ You know ? ” “ Of course I . Give us credit. ” The doctor chuckled amiably lit another cigarette . “ How expect anyone believe liver condition keep squeezing nurses ’ tits every time get chance ? You ’ going give sex want convince people ’ got ailing liver. ” “ That ’ hell price pay keep alive . Why ’ turn knew I faking ? ” “ Why devil I ? ” asked doctor flicker surprise . “ We ’ business illusion together . I ’ always willing lend helping hand fellow conspirator along road survival ’ willing . These people come long way , I ’ rather disappoint . I ’ sentimental old people. ” “ But came see son. ” “ They came late . Maybe ’ even notice difference. ” “ Suppose start crying. ” “ They probably start crying . That ’ one reasons came . I ’ listen outside door break starts getting tacky. ” “ It sounds bit crazy , ” Yossarian reflected . “ What want watch son die , anyway ? ” “ I ’ never able figure one , ” doctor admitted , “ always . Well , say ? All ’ got lie minutes die little . Is asking much ? ” “ All right , ” Yossarian gave . “ If ’ minutes promise wait right outside. ” He warmed role . “ Say , ’ wrap bandage around effect ? ” “ That sounds like splendid idea , ” applauded doctor . They wrapped batch bandages around Yossarian . A team medical orderlies installed tan shades two windows lowered douse room depressing shadows . Yossarian suggested flowers doctor sent orderly find two small bunches fading ones strong sickening smell . When everything place , made Yossarian get back bed lie . Then admitted visitors . The visitors entered uncertainly though felt intruding , tiptoeing stares meek apology , first grieving mother father , brother , glowering heavy-set sailor deep chest . The man woman stepped room stify side side though right familiar , though esoteric , anniversary daguerreotype wall . They short , sere proud . They seemed made iron old , dark clothing . The woman long , brooding oval face burnt umber , coarse graying black hair parted severely middle combed back austerely behind neck without curl , wave ornamentation . Her mouth sullen sad , lined lips compressed . The father stood rigid quaint double-breasted suit padded shoulders much tight . He broad muscular small scale magnificently curled silver mustache crinkled face . His eyes creased rheumy , appeared tragically ill ease stood awkwardly brim black felt fedora held two brawny laborer ’ hands front wide lapels . Poverty hard work inflicted iniquitous damage . The brother looking fight . His round white cap cocked insolent tilt , hands clenched , glared everything room scowl injured truculence . The three creaked forward timidly , holding close stealthy , funereal group inching forward almost step , arrived side bed stood staring Yossarian . There gruesome excruciating silence threatened endure forever . Finally Yossarian unable bear longer cleared throat . The old man spoke last . “ He looks terrible , ” said . “ He ’ sick , Pa. ” “ Giuseppe , ” said mother , seated chair veinous fingers clasped lap . “ My name Yossarian , ” Yossarian said . “ His name Yossarian , Ma . Yossarian , ’ recognize ? I ’ brother John . Don ’ know I ? ” “ Sure I . You ’ brother John. ” “ He recognize ! Pa , knows I . Yossarian , ’ Papa . Say hello Papa. ” “ Hello , Papa , ” said Yossarian . “ Hello , Giuseppe. ” “ His name Yossarian , Pa. ” “ I ’ get terrible looks , ” father said . “ He ’ sick , Pa . The doctor says ’ going die. ” “ I ’ know whether believe doctor , ” father said . “ You know crooked guys are. ” “ Giuseppe , ” mother said , soft , broken chord muted anguish . “ His name Yossarian , Ma .

Colonel Cathcart conceited full colonel combat command age thirty-six ; Colonel Cathcart dejected although already thirty-six still full colonel . Colonel Cathcart impervious absolutes . He could measure progress relationship others , idea excellence something least well men age thing even better . The fact thousands men age older even attained rank major enlivened foppish delight remarkable worth ; hand , fact men age younger already generals contaminated agonizing sense failure made gnaw fingernails unappeasable anxiety even intense Hungry Joe ’ . Colonel Cathcart large , pouting , broadshouldered man close-cropped curly dark hair graying tips ornate cigarette holder purchased day arrived Pianosa take command group . He displayed cigarette holder grandly every occasion learned manipulate adroitly . Unwittingly , discovered deep within fertile aptitude smoking cigarette holder . As far could tell , cigarette holder whole Mediterranean theater operations , thought flattering disquieting . He doubts someone debonair intellectual General Peckem approved smoking cigarette holder , even though two ’ presence rather seldom , way lucky , Colonel Cathcart recognized relief , since General Peckem might approved cigarette holder .

He collected rumors greedily treasured gossip . He believed news heard faith none . He alert constantly every signal , shrewdly sensitive relationships situations exist . He someone know always striving pathetically find going . He blustering , intrepid bully brooded inconsolably terrible ineradicable impressions knew kept making people prominence scarcely aware even alive . Everybody persecuting . Colonel Cathcart lived wits unstable , arithmetical world black eyes feathers cap , overwhelming imaginary triumphs catastrophic imaginary defeats . He oscillated hourly anguish exhilaration , multiplying fantastically grandeur victories exaggerating tragically seriousness defeats . Nobody ever caught napping . If word reached General Dreedle General Peckem seen smiling , frowning , neither , could make rest found acceptable interpretation grumbled mulishly Colonel Korn persuaded relax take things easy . Lieutenant Colonel Korn loyal , indispensable ally got Colonel Cathcart ’ nerves . Colonel Cathcart pledged eternal gratitude Colonel Korn ingenious moves devised furious afterward realized might work . Colonel Cathcart greatly indebted Colonel Korn like . The two close . Colonel Cathcart jealous Colonel Korn ’ intelligence remind often Colonel Korn still lieutenant colonel , even though almost ten years older Colonel Cathcart , Colonel Korn obtained education state university . Colonel Cathcart bewailed miserable fate given invaluable assistant someone common Colonel Korn . It degrading depend thoroughly person educated state university . If someone become indispensable , Colonel Cathcart lamented , could easily someone wealthy well groomed , someone better family mature Colonel Korn treat Colonel Cathcart ’ desire become general frivolously Colonel Cathcart secretly suspected Colonel Korn secretly . Colonel Cathcart wanted general desperately willing try anything , even religion , summoned chaplain office late one morning week raised number missions sixty pointed abruptly toward desk copy The Saturday Evening Post . The colonel wore khaki shirt collar wide open , exposing shadow tough black bristles beard egg-white neck , spongy hanging underlip . He person never tanned , kept sun much possible avoid burning . The colonel head taller chaplain twice broad , swollen , overbearing authority made chaplain feel frail sickly contrast . “ Take look , Chaplain , ” Colonel Cathcart directed , screwing cigarette holder seating affluently swivel chair behind desk . “ Let know think. ” The chaplain looked open magazine compliantly saw editorial spread dealing American bomber group England whose chaplain said prayers briefing room mission . The chaplain almost wept happiness realized colonel going holler . The two hardly spoken since tumultuous evening Colonel Cathcart thrown officers ’ club General Dreedle ’ bidding Chief White Halfoat punched Colonel Moodus nose . The chaplain ’ initial fear colonel intended reprimanding gone back officers ’ club without permission evening . He gone Yossarian Dunbar two come unexpectedly tent clearing woods ask join . Intimidated Colonel Cathcart , nevertheless found easier brave displeasure decline thoughtful invitation two new friends , met one hospital visits weeks worked effectively insulate myriad social vicissitudes involved official duty live closest terms familiarity nine hundred unfamiliar officers enlisted men thought odd duck . The chaplain glued eyes pages magazine . He studied photograph twice read captions intently organized response colonel ’ question grammatically complete sentence rehearsed reorganized mind considerable number times able finally muster courage reply . “ I think saying prayers mission moral highly laudatory procedure , sir , ” offered timidly , waited . “ Yeah , ” said colonel . “ But I want know think ’ work here. ” “ Yes , sir , ” answered chaplain moments . “ I think would. ” “ Then I ’ like give try. ” The colonel ’ ponderous , farinaceous cheeks tinted suddenly glowing patches enthusiasm . He rose feet began walking around excitedly . “ Look much good ’ done people England . Here ’ picture colonel The Saturday Evening Post whose chaplain conducts prayers mission . If prayers work , work us . Maybe say prayers , ’ put picture The Saturday Evening Post. ” The colonel sat smiled distantly lavish contemplation . The chaplain hint expected say next . With pensive expression oblong , rather pale face , allowed gaze settle several high bushels filled red plum tomatoes stood rows walls . He pretended concentrate reply . After realized staring rows rows bushels red plum tomatoes grew intrigued question bushels brimming red plum tomatoes group commander ’ office forgot completely discussion prayer meetings Colonel Cathcart , genial digression , inquired : “ Would like buy , Chaplain ? They come right farm Colonel Korn I hills . I let bushel wholesale. ” “ Oh , , sir . I ’ think so. ” “ That ’ quite right , ” colonel assured liberally . “ You ’ . Milo glad snap produce . These picked yesterday . Notice firm ripe , like young girl ’ breasts. ” The chaplain blushed , colonel understood made mistake . He lowered head shame , cumbersome face burning . His fingers felt gross unwieldy . He hated chaplain venomously chaplain making coarse blunder observation circumstances , knew , would considered witty urbane . He tried miserably recall means extricating devastating embarrassment . He recalled instead chaplain captain , straightened shocked outraged gasp . His cheeks grew tight fury thought duped humiliation man almost age still captain , swung upon chaplain avengingly look murderous antagonism chaplain began tremble . The colonel punished sadistically long , glowering , malignant , hateful , silent stare . “ We speaking something else , ” reminded chaplain cuttingly last . “ We speaking firm , ripe breasts beautiful young girls something else entirely . We speaking conducting religious services briefing room mission . Is reason ’ ? ” “ No , sir , ” chaplain mumbled . “ Then ’ begin afternoon ’ mission. ” The colonel ’ hostility softened gradually applied details . “ Now , I want give lot thought kind prayers ’ going say . I ’ want anything heavy sad . I ’ like keep light snappy , something send boys feeling pretty good . Do know I mean ? I ’ want Kingdom God Valley Death stuff . That ’ negative . What making sour face ? ” “ I ’ sorry , sir , ” chaplain stammered . “ I happened thinking Twenty-third Psalm said that. ” “ How one go ? ” “ That ’ one referring , sir . ‘ The Lord shepherd ; I- ‘ ” “ That ’ one I referring . It ’ . What else got ? ” “ ’ Save , O God ; waters come unto- ‘ ” “ No waters , ” colonel decided , blowing ruggedly cigarette holder flipping butt combed-brass ash tray . “ Why ’ try something musical ? How harps willows ? ” “ That rivers Babylon , sir , ” chaplain replied . “ ’ …there sat , yea , wept , remembered Zion. ’ ” “ Zion ? Let ’ forget one right . I ’ like know one even got . Haven ’ got anything humorous stays away waters valleys God ? I ’ like keep away subject religion altogether can. ” The chaplain apologetic . “ I ’ sorry , sir , prayers I know rather somber tone make least passing reference God. ” “ Then let ’ get new ones . The men already enough bitching missions I send without rubbing sermons God death Paradise . Why ’ take positive approach ? Why ’ pray something good , like tighter bomb pattern , example ? Couldn ’ pray tighter bomb pattern ? ” “ Well , yes , sir , I suppose , ” chaplain answered hesitantly . “ You ’ even need ’ wanted . You could yourself. ” “ I know I could , ” colonel responded tartly . “ But think ’ ? I could shop food , , ’ Milo ’ job , ’ ’ every group area . Your job lead us prayer , ’ going lead us prayer tighter bomb pattern every mission . Is clear ? I think tighter bomb pattern something really worth praying . It feather caps General Peckem . General Peckem feels makes much nicer aerial photograph bombs explode close together. ” “ General Peckem , sir ? ” “ That ’ right , Chaplain , ” colonel replied , chuckling paternally chaplain ’ look puzzlement . “ I ’ want get around , looks like General Dreedle finally way General Peckem slated replace . Frankly , I ’ going sorry see happen . General Peckem good man , I think ’ much better . On hand , might never take place , ’ still remain General Dreedle . Frankly , I ’ sorry see happen either , General Dreedle another good man , I think ’ much better . I hope ’ going keep hat , Chaplain . I ’ want either one get idea I throwing support side other. ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ That ’ good , ” colonel exclaimed , stood jovially . “ But gossip ’ getting us The Saturday Evening Post , eh , Chaplain ? Let ’ see kind procedure evolve . Incidentally , Chaplain , word beforehand Colonel Korn . Understand ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” Colonel Cathcart began tramping back forth reflectively narrow corridors left bushels plum tomatoes desk wooden chairs center room . “ I suppose ’ keep waiting outside briefing , information classified . We slip Major Danby synchronizing watches . I ’ think ’ anything secret right time . We ’ allocate minute half schedule . Will minute half enough ? ” “ Yes , sir . If ’ include time necessary excuse atheists room admit enlisted men. ” Colonel Cathcart stopped tracks . “ What atheists ? ” bellowed defensively , whole manner changing flash one virtuous belligerent denial . “ There atheists outfit ! Atheism law , ’ ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ It ’ ? ” The colonel surprised . “ Then ’ un-American , ’ ? ” “ I ’ sure , sir , ” answered chaplain . “ Well , I ! ” colonel declared . “ I ’ going disrupt religious services accommodate bunch lousy atheists . They ’ getting special privileges . They stay right pray rest us . And ’ enlisted men ? Just hell get act ? ” The chaplain felt face flush . “ I ’ sorry , sir . I assumed would want enlisted men present , since would going along mission. ” “ Well , I ’ . They ’ got God chaplain , ’ ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ What talking ? You mean pray God ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ And He listens ? ” “ I think , sir. ” “ Well , I ’ damned , ” remarked colonel , snorted quizzical amusement . His spirits drooped suddenly moment later , ran hand nervously short , black , graying curls . “ Do really think ’ good idea let enlisted men ? ” asked concern . “ I think proper , sir. ” “ I ’ like keep , ” confided colonel , began cracking knuckles savagely wandered back forth . “ Oh , ’ get wrong , Chaplain . It ’ I think enlisted men dirty , common inferior . It ’ ’ enough room . Frankly , though , I ’ soon officers enlisted men ’ fraternize briefing room . They see enough mission , seems . Some best friends enlisted men , understand , ’ close I care let come . Honestly , Chaplain , ’ want sister marry enlisted man , would ? ” “ My sister enlisted man , sir , ” chaplain replied . The colonel stopped tracks eyed chaplain sharply make certain ridiculed . “ Just mean remark , Chaplain ? Are trying funny ? ” “ Oh , , sir , ” chaplain hastened explain look excruciating discomfort . “ She ’ master sergeant Marines. ” The colonel never liked chaplain loathed distrusted . He experienced keen premonition danger wondered chaplain plotting , chaplain ’ reticent , unimpressive manner really sinister disguise masking fiery ambition , way deep , crafty unscrupulous . There something funny chaplain , colonel soon detected . The chaplain standing stiffly attention , colonel forgotten put ease . Let stay way , colonel decided vindictively , show boss safeguard loss dignity might devolve acknowledging omission . Colonel Cathcart drawn hypnotically toward window massive , dull stare moody introspection . The enlisted men always treacherous , decided . He looked downward mournful gloom skeet-shooting range ordered built officers headquarters staff , recalled mortifying afternoon General Dreedle tongue-lashed ruthlessly front Colonel Korn Major Danby ordered throw open range enlisted men officers combat duty . The skeet-shooting range real black eye , Colonel Cathcart forced conclude . He positive General Dreedle never forgotten , even though positive General Dreedle ’ even remember , really unjust , Colonel Cathcart lamented , since idea skeet-shooting range real feather cap , even though real black eye . Colonel Cathcart helpless assess exactly much ground gained lost goddam skeet-shooting range wished Colonel Korn office right evaluate entire episode still one time assuage fears . It perplexing , discouraging . Colonel Cathcart took cigarette holder mouth , stood end inside pocket shirt , began gnawing fingernails hands grievously . Everybody , sick soul Colonel Korn moment crisis help decide prayer meetings . He almost faith chaplain , still captain . “ Do think , ” asked , “ keeping enlisted men might interfere chances getting results ? ” The chaplain hesitated , feeling unfamiliar ground . “ Yes , sir , ” replied finally . “ I think ’ conceivable action could interfere chances prayers tighter bomb pattern answered. ” “ I ’ even thinking ! ” cried colonel , eyes blinking splashing like puddles . “ You mean God might even decide punish giving us looser bomb pattern ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” said chaplain . “ It ’ conceivable He might. ” “ The hell , , ” colonel asserted huff independence . “ I ’ going set damned prayer meetings make things worse are. ” With scornful snicker , settled behind desk , replaced empty cigarette holder mouth lapsed parturient silence moments . “ Now I think , ” confessed , much chaplain , “ men pray God probably ’ hot idea anyway . The editors The Saturday Evening Post might co-operated. ” The colonel abandoned project remorse , conceived entirely hoped unveil striking demonstration everyone real need Colonel Korn . Once gone , glad rid , troubled start danger instituting plan without first checking Colonel Korn . He heaved immense sigh contentment . He much higher opinion idea abandoned , made wise decision , felt , , important , made wise decision without consulting Colonel Korn . “ Will , sir ? ” asked chaplain . “ Yeah , ” said Colonel Cathcart . “ Unless ’ got something else suggest. ” “ No , sir . Only… ” The colonel lifted eyes though affronted studied chaplain aloof distrust . “ Only , Chaplain ? ” “ Sir , ” said chaplain , “ men upset since raised number missions sixty . They ’ asked speak it. ” The colonel silent . The chaplain ’ face reddened roots sandy hair waited . The colonel kept squirming long time fixed , uninterested look devoid emotion . “ Tell ’ war going , ” advised finally flat voice . “ Thank , sir , I , ” chaplain replied flood gratitude colonel finally said something . “ They wondering ’ requisition replacement crews waiting Africa take places let go home. ” “ That ’ administrative matter , ” colonel said . “ It ’ none business. ” He pointed languidly toward wall . “ Help plum tomato , Chaplain . Go ahead , ’ me. ” “ Thank , sir . Sir- “ “ Don ’ mention . How like living woods , Chaplain ? Is everything hunky dory ? ” “ Yes , sir. ” “ That ’ good . You get touch us need anything. ” “ Yes , sir . Thank , sir . Sir- “ “ Thanks dropping around , Chaplain . I ’ got work . You ’ let know think anything getting names The Saturday Evening Post , ’ ? ” “ Yes , sir , I will. ” The chaplain braced prodigious effort plunged ahead brazenly . “ I ’ particularly concerned condition one bombardiers , sir . Yossarian. ” The colonel glanced quickly start vague recognition . “ Who ? ” asked alarm . “ Yossarian , sir. ” “ Yossarian ? ” “ Yes , sir . Yossarian . He ’ bad way , sir . I ’ afraid ’ able suffer much longer without something desperate. ” “ Is fact , Chaplain ? ” “ Yes , sir . I ’ afraid is. ” The colonel thought heavy silence moments . “ Tell trust God , ” advised finally . “ Thank , sir , ” said chaplain . “ I will. ” 20 CORPORAL WHITCOMB The late-August morning sun hot steamy , breeze balcony . The chaplain moved slowly . He downcast burdened self-reproach stepped without noise colonel ’ office rubber-soled rubber-heeled brown shoes . He hated construed cowardice . He intended take much stronger stand Colonel Cathcart matter sixty missions , speak courage , logic eloquence subject begun feel deeply . Instead failed miserably , choked face opposition stronger personality . It familiar , ignominious experience , opinion low . He choked even second later spied Colonel Korn ’ tubby monochrome figure trotting curved , wide , yellow stone staircase toward lackadaisical haste great dilapidated lobby lofty walls cracked dark marble circular floor cracked grimy tile . The chaplain even frightened Colonel Korn Colonel Cathcart . The swarthy , middle-aged lieutenant colonel rimless , icy glasses faceted , bald , domelike pate always touching sensitively tips splayed fingers disliked chaplain impolite frequently . He kept chaplain constant state terror curt , derisive tongue knowing , cynical eyes chaplain never brave enough meet accidental second . Inevitably , chaplain ’ attention , cowered meekly , focused Colonel Korn ’ midriff , shirttails bunching inside sagging belt ballooning waist gave appearance slovenly girth made seem inches shorter middle height . Colonel Korn untidy disdainful man oily skin deep , hard lines running almost straight nose crepuscular jowls square , clefted chin . His face dour , glanced chaplain without recognition two drew close staircase prepared pass . “ Hiya , Father , ” said tonelessly without looking chaplain . “ How ’ going ? ” “ Good morning , sir , ” chaplain replied , discerning wisely Colonel Korn expected nothing way response . Colonel Korn proceeding stairs without slackening pace , chaplain resisted temptation remind Catholic Anabaptist , therefore neither necessary correct address Father . He almost certain Colonel Korn remembered calling Father look bland innocence another one Colonel Korn ’ methods taunting Anabaptist . Colonel Korn halted without warning almost came whirling back upon chaplain glare infuriated suspicion . The chaplain petrified . “ What plum tomato , Chaplain ? ” Colonel Korn demanded roughly . The chaplain looked arm surprise plum tomato Colonel Cathcart invited take . “ I got Colonel Cathcart ’ office , sir , ” managed reply . “ Does colonel know took ? ” “ Yes , sir . He gave me. ” “ Oh , case I guess ’ okay , ” Colonel Korn said , mollified . He smiled without warmth , jabbing crumpled folds shirt back inside trousers thumbs . His eyes glinted keenly private satisfying mischief . “ What Colonel Cathcart want see , Father ? ” asked suddenly . The chaplain tongue-tied indecision moment . “ I ’ think I ought- “ “ Saying prayers editors The Saturday Evening Post ? ” The chaplain almost smiled . “ Yes , sir. ” Colonel Korn enchanted intuition . He laughed disparagingly . “ You know , I afraid ’ begin thinking something ridiculous soon saw week ’ Saturday Evening Post . I hope succeeded showing atrocious idea is. ” “ He decided , sir. ” “ That ’ good . I ’ glad convinced editors The Saturday Evening Post likely run story twice give publicity obscure colonel . How things wilderness , Father ? Are able manage ? ” “ Yes , sir . Everything working out. ” “ That ’ good . I ’ happy hear nothing complain . Let us know need anything make comfortable . We want good time there. ” “ Thank , sir . I will. ” Noise growing stir rose lobby . It almost lunchtime , earliest arrivals drifting headquarters mess halls , enlisted men officers separating different dining halls facing sides archaic rotunda . Colonel Korn stopped smiling . “ You lunch us day ago , ’ , Father ? ” asked meaningfully . “ Yes , sir . The day yesterday. ” “ That ’ I thought , ” Colonel Korn said , paused let point sink . “ Well , take easy , Father . I ’ see around ’ time eat again. ” “ Thank , sir. ” The chaplain certain five officers ’ five enlisted men ’ mess halls scheduled lunch day , system rotation worked Colonel Korn complicated , forgotten records back tent . The chaplain officer attached Group Headquarters reside moldering red-stone Group Headquarters building smaller satellite structures rose grounds disjuncted relationship . The chaplain lived clearing woods four miles away officers ’ club first four squadron areas stretched away Group Headquarters distant line . The chaplain lived alone spacious , square tent also office . Sounds revelry traveled night officers ’ club kept awake often turned tossed cot passive , half-voluntary exile . He able gauge effect mild pills took occasionally help sleep felt guilty days afterward . The one lived chaplain clearing woods Corporal Whitcomb , assistant . Corporal Whitcomb , atheist , disgruntled subordinate felt could chaplain ’ job much better chaplain viewed , therefore , underprivileged victim social inequity . He lived tent spacious square chaplain ’ . He openly rude contemptuous chaplain discovered chaplain would let get away . The borders two tents clearing stood four five feet apart . It Colonel Korn mapped way life chaplain . One good reason making chaplain live outside Group Headquarters building Colonel Korn ’ theory dwelling tent parishioners would bring closer communication . Another good reason fact chaplain around Headquarters time made officers uncomfortable . It one thing maintain liaison Lord , favor ; something else , though , Him hanging around twenty-four hours day . All , Colonel Korn described Major Danby , jittery goggle-eyed group operations officer , chaplain pretty soft ; little listen troubles others , bury dead , visit bedridden conduct religious services . And many dead bury , Colonel Korn pointed , since opposition German fighter planes virtually ceased since close ninety per cent fatalities still , estimated , perished behind enemy lines disappeared inside clouds , chaplain nothing disposing remains . The religious services certainly great strain , either , since conducted week Group Headquarters building attended men . Actually , chaplain learning love clearing woods . Both Corporal Whitcomb provided every convenience neither might ever plead discomfort basis seeking permission return Headquarters building . The chaplain rotated breakfasts , lunches dinners separate sets among eight squadron mess halls ate every fifth meal enlisted men ’ mess Group Headquarters every tenth meal officers ’ mess . Back home Wisconsin chaplain fond gardening , heart welled glorious impression fertility fruition time contemplated low , prickly boughs stunted trees waist-high weeds thickets almost walled . In spring longed plant begonias zinnias narrow bed around tent deterred fear Corporal Whitcomb ’ rancor . The chaplain relished privacy isolation verdant surroundings reverie meditation living fostered . Fewer people came troubles formerly , allowed measure gratitude . The chaplain mix freely comfortable conversation . He missed wife three small children , missed . What displeased Corporal Whitcomb chaplain , apart fact chaplain believed God , lack initiative aggressiveness . Corporal Whitcomb regarded low attendance religious services sad reflection status . His mind germinated feverishly challenging new ideas sparking great spiritual revival dreamed architect-box lunches , church socials , form letters families men killed injured combat , censorship , Bingo . But chaplain blocked . Corporal Whitcomb bridled vexation beneath chaplain ’ restraint , spied room improvement everywhere . It people like chaplain , concluded , responsible giving religion bad name making pariahs . Unlike chaplain , Corporal Whitcomb detested seclusion clearing woods . One first things intended deposed chaplain move back Group Headquarters building , could right thick things . When chaplain drove back clearing leaving Colonel Korn , Corporal Whitcomb outside muggy haze talking conspiratorial tones strange chubby man maroon corduroy bathrobe gray flannel pajamas . The chaplain recognized bathrobe pajamas official hospital attire . Neither two men gave sign recognition . The stranger ’ gums painted purple ; corduroy bathrobe decorated back picture B-25 nosing orange bursts flak front six neat rows tiny bombs signifying sixty combat missions flown . The chaplain struck sight stopped stare . Both men broke conversation waited stony silence go . The chaplain hurried inside tent . He heard , imagined heard , tittering . Corporal Whitcomb walked moment later demanded , “ What ’ ? ” “ There ’ anything new , ” chaplain replied averted eyes . “ Was anyone see ? ” “ Just crackpot Yossarian . He ’ real troublemaker , ’ ? ” “ I ’ sure ’ crackpot , ” chaplain observed . “ That ’ right , take part , ” said Corporal Whitcomb injured tone , stamped . The chaplain could believe Corporal Whitcomb offended really walked . As soon realize , Corporal Whitcomb walked back . “ You always side people , ” Corporal Whitcomb accused . “ You ’ back men . That ’ one things ’ wrong you. ” “ I ’ intend side , ” chaplain apologized . “ I making statement. ” “ What Colonel Cathcart want ? ” “ It ’ anything important . He wanted discuss possibility saying prayers briefing room mission. ” “ All right , ’ tell , ” Corporal Whitcomb snapped walked . The chaplain felt terrible . No matter considerate tried , seemed always managed hurt Corporal Whitcomb ’ feelings . He gazed remorsefully saw orderly forced upon Colonel Korn keep tent clean attend belongings neglected shine shoes . Corporal Whitcomb came back . “ You never trust information , ” whined truculently . “ You ’ confidence men . That ’ another one things ’ wrong you. ” “ Yes , I , ” chaplain assured guiltily . “ I lots confidence you. ” “ Then letters ? ” “ No , , ” chaplain pleaded , cringing . “ Not letters . Please ’ bring . I ’ let know I change mind. ” Corporal Whitcomb looked furious . “ Is ? Well , ’ right sit shake head I work . Didn ’ see guy outside pictures painted bathrobe ? ” “ Is see ? ” “ No , ” Corporal Whitcomb said , walked . It hot humid inside tent , chaplain felt turning damp . He listened like unwilling eavesdropper muffled , indistinguishable drone lowered voices outside . As sat inertly rickety bridge table served desk , lips closed , eyes blank , face , pale ochre hue ancient , confined clusters minute acne pits , color texture uncracked almond shell . He racked memory clue origin Corporal Whitcomb ’ bitterness toward . In way unable fathom , convinced done unforgivable wrong . It seemed incredible lasting ire Corporal Whitcomb ’ could stemmed rejection Bingo form letters home families men killed combat . The chaplain despondent acceptance ineptitude . He intended weeks heart-to-heart talk Corporal Whitcomb order find bothering , already ashamed might find . Outside tent , Corporal Whitcomb snickered . The man chuckled . For precarious seconds , chaplain tingled weird , occult sensation experienced identical situation prior time existence . He endeavored trap nourish impression order predict , perhaps even control , incident would occur next , afatus melted away unproductively , known beforehand would . Déjà vu . The subtle , recurring confusion illusion reality characteristic paramnesia fascinated chaplain , knew number things . He knew , example , called paramnesia , interested well corollary optical phenomena jamais vu , never seen , presque vu , almost seen . There terrifying , sudden moments objects , concepts even people chaplain lived almost life inexplicably took unfamiliar irregular aspect never seen made totally strange : jamais vu . And moments almost saw absolute truth brilliant flashes clarity almost came : presque vu . The episode naked man tree Snowden ’ funeral mystified thoroughly . It déjà vu , time experienced sensation ever seen naked man tree Snowden ’ funeral . It jamais vu , since apparition someone , something , familiar appearing unfamiliar guise . And certainly presque vu , chaplain see . A jeep started backfire directly outside roared away . Had naked man tree Snowden ’ funeral merely hallucination ? Or true revelation ? The chaplain trembled mere idea . He wanted desperately confide Yossarian , time thought occurrence decided think , although think could sure ever really thought . Corporal Whitcomb sauntered back wearing shiny new smirk leaned elbow impertinently center pole chaplain ’ tent . “ Do know guy red bathrobe ? ” asked boastfully . “ That C.I.D . man fractured nose . He came hospital official business . He ’ conducting investigation. ” The chaplain raised eyes quickly obsequious commiseration . “ I hope ’ trouble . Is anything I ? ” “ No , I ’ trouble , ” Corporal Whitcomb replied grin . “ You . They ’ going crack signing Washington Irving ’ name letters ’ signing Washington Irving ’ name . How like ? ” “ I ’ signing Washington Irving ’ name letters , ” said chaplain . “ You ’ lie , ” Corporal Whitcomb answered . “ I ’ one convince. ” “ But I ’ lying. ” “ I ’ care whether ’ lying . They ’ going get intercepting Major Major ’ correspondence , . A lot stuff classified information. ” “ What correspondence ? ” asked chaplain plaintively rising exasperation . “ I ’ never even seen Major Major ’ correspondence. ” “ You ’ lie , ” Corporal Whitcomb replied . “ I ’ one convince. ” “ But I ’ lying ! ” protested chaplain . “ I ’ see shout , ” Corporal Whitcomb retorted injured look . He came away center pole shook finger chaplain emphasis . “ I biggest favor anybody ever whole life , ’ even realize . Every time tries report superiors , somebody hospital censors details . He ’ going batty weeks trying turn . I put censor ’ okay letter without even reading . That make good impression C.I.D . headquarters . It let know ’ least bit afraid whole truth come out. ” The chaplain reeling confusion . “ But ’ authorized censor letters , ? ” “ Of course , ” Corporal Whitcomb answered . “ Only officers ever authorized . I censored name. ” “ But I ’ authorized censor letters either . Am I ? ” “ I took care , , ” Corporal Whitcomb assured . “ I signed somebody else ’ name you. ” “ Isn ’ forgery ? ” “ Oh , ’ worry either . The one might complain case forgery person whose name forged , I looked interests picking dead man . I used Washington Irving ’ name. ” Corporal Whitcomb scrutinized chaplain ’ face closely sign rebellion breezed ahead confidently concealed irony . “ That pretty quick thinking part , ’ ? ” “ I ’ know , ” chaplain wailed softly quavering voice , squinting grotesque contortions anguish incomprehension . “ I ’ think I understand ’ telling . How make good impression signed Washington Irving ’ name instead ? ” “ Because ’ convinced Washington Irving . Don ’ see ? They ’ know you. ” “ But ’ belief want dispel ? Won ’ help prove ? ” “ If I thought going stuffy , I ’ even tried help , ” Corporal Whitcomb declared indignantly , walked . A second later walked back . “ I biggest favor anybody ever whole life ’ even know . You ’ know show appreciation . That ’ another one things ’ wrong you. ” “ I ’ sorry , ” chaplain apologized contritely . “ I really sorry . It ’ I ’ completely stunned ’ telling I ’ even realize I ’ saying . I ’ really grateful you. ” “ Then letting send form letters ? ” Corporal Whitcomb demanded immediately . “ Can I begin working first drafts ? ” The chaplain ’ jaw dropped astonishment . “ No , , ” groaned . “ Not now. ” Corporal Whitcomb incensed . “ I ’ best friend ’ got ’ even know , ” asserted belligerently , walked chaplain ’ tent . He walked back . “ I ’ side ’ even realize . Don ’ know serious trouble ’ ? That C.I.D . man gone rushing back hospital write brand-new report tomato. ” “ What tomato ? ” chaplain asked , blinking . “ The plum tomato hiding hand first showed . There . The tomato ’ still holding hand right minute ! ” The captain unclenched fingers surprise saw still holding plum tomato obtained Colonel Cathcart ’ office . He set quickly bridge table . “ I got tomato Colonel Cathcart , ” said , struck ludicrous explanation sounded . “ He insisted I take it. ” “ You ’ lie , ” Corporal Whitcomb answered . “ I ’ care whether stole not. ” “ Stole ? ” chaplain exclaimed amazement . “ Why I want steal plum tomato ? ” “ That ’ exactly us stumped , ” said Corporal Whitcomb . “ And C.I.D . man figured might important secret papers hidden away inside it. ” The chaplain sagged limply beneath mountainous weight despair . “ I ’ important secret papers hidden away inside , ” stated simply . “ I ’ even want begin . Here , see yourself. ” “ I ’ want it. ” “ Please take away , ” chaplain pleaded voice barely audible . “ I want rid it. ” “ I ’ want , ” Corporal Whitcomb snapped , stalked angry face , suppressing smile great jubilation forged powerful new alliance C.I.D . man succeeded convincing chaplain really displeased . Poor Whitcomb , sighed chaplain , blamed assistant ’ malaise . He sat mutely ponderous , stultifying melancholy , waiting expectantly Corporal Whitcomb walk back . He disappointed heard peremptory crunch Corporal Whitcomb ’ footsteps recede silence . There nothing wanted next . He decided pass lunch Milky Way Baby Ruth foot locker swallows luke-warm water canteen . He felt surrounded dense , overwhelming fogs possibilities could perceive glimmer light . He dreaded Colonel Cathcart would think news suspected Washington Irving brought , fell fretting Colonel Cathcart already thinking even broached subject sixty missions . There much unhappiness world , reflected , bowing head dismally beneath tragic thought , nothing could anybody ’ , least . 21 GENERAL DREEDLE Colonel Cathcart thinking anything chaplain , tangled brand-new , menacing problem : Yossarian ! Yossarian ! The mere sound execrable , ugly name made blood run cold breath come labored gasps . The chaplain ’ first mention name Yossarian ! tolled deep memory like portentous gong . As soon latch door clicked shut , whole humiliating recollection naked man formation came cascading upon mortifying , choking flood stinging details . He began perspire tremble . There sinister unlikely coincidence exposed diabolical implication anything less hideous omens . The name man stood naked ranks day receive Distinguished Flying Cross General Dreedle also been-Yossarian ! And man named Yossarian threatening make trouble sixty missions ordered men group fly . Colonel Cathcart wondered gloomily Yossarian . He climbed feet air intolerable woe began moving office . He felt presence mysterious . The naked man formation , conceded cheerlessly , real black eye . So tampering bomb line mission Bologna seven-day delay destroying bridge Ferrara , even though destroying bridge Ferrara finally , remembered glee , real feather cap , although losing plane second time around , recalled dejection , another black eye , even though another real feather cap getting medal approved bombardier gotten real black eye first place going around target twice . That bombardier ’ name , remembered suddenly another stupefying shock , also Yossarian ! Now three ! His viscous eyes bulged astonishment whipped around alarm see taking place behind . A moment ago Yossarians life ; multiplying like hobgoblins . He tried make grow calm . Yossarian common name ; perhaps really three Yossarians two Yossarians , maybe even one Yossarian-but really made difference ! The colonel still grave peril . Intuition warned drawing close immense inscrutable cosmic climax , broad , meaty , towering frame tingled head toe thought Yossarian , whoever would eventually turn , destined serve nemesis . Colonel Cathcart superstitious , believe omens , sat right back behind desk made cryptic notation memorandum pad look whole suspicious business Yossarians right away . He wrote reminder heavy decisive hand , amplifying sharply series coded punctuation marks underlining whole message twice , read : Yossarian ! ! ! ( ? ) ! The colonel sat back finished extremely pleased prompt action taken meet sinister crisis . Yossarian-the sight name made shudder . There many esses . It subversive . It like word subversive . It like seditious insidious , like socialist , suspicious , fascist Communist . It odious , alien , distasteful name , inspire confidence . It like clean , crisp , honest , American names Cathcart , Peckem Dreedle . Colonel Cathcart rose slowly began drifting office . Almost unconsciously , picked plum tomato top one bushels took voracious bite . He made wry face threw rest plum tomato waste-basket . The colonel like plum tomatoes , even , even . These purchased different market places Pianosa Colonel Korn various identities , moved colonel ’ farmhouse hills dead night , transported Group Headquarters next morning sale Milo , paid Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn premium prices . Colonel Cathcart often wondered plum tomatoes legal , Colonel Korn said , tried brood often . He way knowing whether house hills legal , either , since Colonel Korn made arrangements . Colonel Cathcart know owned house rented , acquired much , anything , costing . Colonel Korn lawyer , Colonel Korn assured fraud , extortion , currency manipulation , embezzlement , income tax evasion black-market speculations legal , Colonel Cathcart position disagree . All Colonel Cathcart knew house hills house hated . He never bored spending two three days every week necessary sustain illusion damp drafty stone farmhouse hills golden palace carnal delights . Officers ’ clubs everywhere pulsated blurred knowing accounts lavish , hushed-up drinking sex orgies secret , intimate nights ecstasy beautiful , tantalizing , readily aroused easily satisfied Italian courtesans , film actresses , models countesses . No private nights ecstasy hushed-up drinking sex orgies ever occurred . They might occurred either General Dreedle General Peckem evinced interest taking part orgies , neither ever , colonel certainly going waste time energy making love beautiful women unless something . The colonel dreaded dank lonely nights farmhouse dull , uneventful days . He much fun back Group , browbeating everyone ’ afraid . However , Colonel Korn kept reminding , much glamour farmhouse hills never used . He drove farmhouse time mood self-pity . He carried shotgun jeep spent monotonous hours shooting birds plum tomatoes grow untended rows much trouble harvest . Among officers inferior rank toward Colonel Cathcart still deemed prudent show respect , included Major -- de Coverley , even though want sure even . Major -- de Coverley great mystery Major Major everyone else ever took notice . Colonel Cathcart idea whether look look attitude toward Major -- de Coverley . Major -- de Coverley major , even though ages older Colonel Cathcart ; time , many people treated Major -- de Coverley profound fearful veneration Colonel Cathcart hunch might know something . Major -- de Coverley ominous , incomprehensible presence kept constantly edge even Colonel Korn tended wary . Everyone afraid , one knew . No one even knew Major -- de Coverley ’ first name , one ever temerity ask . Colonel Cathcart knew Major -- de Coverley away rejoiced absence occurred Major -- de Coverley might away somewhere conspiring , wished Major -- de Coverley back squadron belonged could watched . In little Colonel Cathcart ’ arches began ache pacing back forth much . He sat behind desk resolved embark upon mature systematic evaluation entire military situation . With businesslike air man knows get things done , found large white pad , drew straight line middle crossed near top , dividing page two blank columns equal width . He rested moment critical rumination . Then huddled desk , head left column , cramped finicky hand , wrote , “ Black Eyes ! ! ! ” At top right column wrote , “ Feathers My Cap ! ! ! ! ! ” He leaned back inspect chart admiringly objective perspective . After seconds solemn deliberation , licked tip pencil carefully wrote “ Black Eyes ! ! ! , ” intent intervals : Ferrara Bologna ( bomb line moved map ) Skeet range Naked man information ( Avignon ) Then added : Food poisoning ( Bologna ) Moaning ( epidemic Avignon briefing ) Then added : Chaplain ( hanging around officers ’ club every night ) He decided charitable chaplain , even though like , “ Feathers My Cap ! ! ! ! ! ” wrote : Chaplain ( hanging around officers ’ club every night ) The two chaplain entries , therefore , neutralized . Alongside “ Ferrara ” “ Naked man formation ( Avignon ) ” wrote : Yossarian ! Alongside “ Bologna ( bomb line moved map ) ” “ Food poisoning ( Bologna ) ” “ Moaning ( epidemic Avignon briefing ) ” wrote bold , decisive hand : ? Those entries labeled “ ? ” ones wanted investigate immediately determine Yossarian played part . Suddenly arm began shake , unable write . He rose feet terror , feeling sticky fat , rushed open window gulp fresh air . His gaze fell skeet-range , reeled away sharp cry distress , wild feverish eyes scanning walls office frantically though swarming Yossarians . Nobody loved . General Dreedle hated , although General Peckem liked , although ’ sure , since Colonel Cargill , General Peckem ’ aide , undoubtedly ambitions probably sabotaging General Peckem every opportunity . The good colonel , decided , dead colonel , except . The colonel trusted Colonel Moodus , even father-in-law . Milo , course , big feather cap , although group bombed Milo ’ planes probably terrible black eye , even though Milo ultimately stilled protest disclosing huge net profit syndicate realized deal enemy convincing everyone bombing men planes therefore really commendable lucrative blow side private enterprise . The colonel insecure Milo colonels trying lure away , Colonel Cathcart still lousy Big Chief White Halfoat group lousy , lazy Captain Black claimed one really responsible bomb line ’ moved Big Siege Bologna . Colonel Cathcart liked Big Chief White Halfoat Big Chief White Halfoat kept punching lousy Colonel Moodus nose every time got drunk Colonel Moodus around . He wished Big Chief White Halfoat would begin punching Colonel Korn fat face , . Colonel Korn lousy smart aleck . Someone Twenty-seventh Air Force Headquarters sent back every report wrote blistering rebuke , Colonel Korn bribed clever mail clerk named Wintergreen try find . Losing plane Ferrara second time around done good , admit , neither plane disappear inside cloud-that one ’ even written ! He tried recall , longingly , Yossarian lost plane cloud realized Yossarian could possibly lost plane cloud still around raising big stink fly lousy five missions . Maybe sixty missions many men fly , Colonel Cathcart reasoned , Yossarian objected flying , remembered forcing men fly missions everyone else tangible achievement going . As Colonel Korn often remarked , war crawling group commanders merely duty , required sort dramatic gesture like making group fly combat missions bomber group spotlight unique qualities leadership . Certainly none generals seemed object , although far could detect ’ particularly impressed either , made suspect perhaps sixty combat missions nearly enough ought increase number seventy , eighty , hundred , even two hundred , three hundred , six thousand ! Certainly would much better somebody suave like General Peckem somebody boorish insensitive like General Dreedle , General Peckem discernment , intelligence Ivy League background appreciate enjoy full value , although General Peckem never given slightest indication appreciated enjoyed . Colonel Cathcart felt perceptive enough realize visible signals recognition never necessary sophisticated , self-assured people like General Peckem could warm distance innate mutual understanding . It enough like kind , knew matter waiting discreetly preferment right time , although rotted Colonel Cathcart ’ self-esteem observe General Peckem never deliberately sought labored harder impress Colonel Cathcart epigrams erudition impress anyone else earshot , even enlisted men . Either Colonel Cathcart ’ getting General Peckem General Peckem scintillating , discriminating , intellectual , forward-looking personality pretended really General Dreedle sensitive , charming , brilliant sophisticated would certainly much better , suddenly Colonel Cathcart absolutely conception strongly stood anyone began banging buzzer fist Colonel Korn come running office assure everybody loved , Yossarian figment imagination , making wonderful progress splendid valiant campaign waging become general . Actually , Colonel Cathcart chance hell becoming general . For one thing , ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen , also wanted general always distorted , destroyed , rejected misdirected correspondence , Colonel Cathcart might credit . For another , already general , General Dreedle knew General Peckem job know stop . General Dreedle , wing commander , blunt , chunky , barrel-chested man early fifties . His nose squat red , lumpy white , bunched-up eyelids circling small gray eyes like haloes bacon fat . He nurse son-in law , prone long , ponderous silences drinking much . General Dreedle wasted much time Army job well , late . New power alignments coalesced without loss cope . At unguarded moments hard sullen face slipped somber , preoccupied look defeat frustration . General Dreedle drank great deal . His moods arbitrary unpredictable . “ War hell , ” declared frequently , drunk sober , really meant , although prevent making good living taking son-in-law business , even though two bickered constantly . “ That bastard , ” General Dreedle would complain son-in-law contemptuous grunt anyone happened standing beside curve bar officers ’ club . “ Everything ’ got owes . I made , lousy son bitch ! He ’ got brains enough get ahead own. ” “ He thinks knows everything , ” Colonel Moodus would retort sulking tone audience end bar . “ He ’ take criticism ’ listen advice. ” “ All give advice , ” General Dreedle would observe rasping snort . “ If ’ , ’ still corporal. ” General Dreedle always accompanied Colonel Moodus nurse , delectable piece ass anyone saw ever laid eyes . General Dreedle ’ nurse chubby , short blonde . She plump dimpled cheeks , happy blue eyes , neat curly turned-up hair . She smiled everyone never spoke unless spoken . Her bosom lush complexion clear . She irresistible , men edged away carefully . She succulent , sweet , docile dumb , drove everyone crazy General Dreedle . “ You see naked , ” General Dreedle chortled croupy relish , nurse stood smiling proudly right shoulder . “ Back Wing ’ got uniform room made purple silk ’ tight nipples stand like bing cherries . Milo got fabric . There ’ even room enough panties brassière underneath . I make wear nights Moodus around drive crazy. ” General Dreedle laughed hoarsely . “ You see goes inside blouse every time shifts weight . She drives mind . The first time I catch putting hand woman I ’ bust horny bastard right private put K.P . year. ” “ He keeps around drive crazy , ” Colonel Moodus accused aggrievedly end bar . “ Back Wing ’ got uniform made purple silk ’ tight nipples stand like bing cherries . There ’ even room panties brassière underneath . You hear rustle every time shifts weight . The first time I make pass girl ’ bust right private put K.P . year . She drives mind. ” “ He ’ gotten laid since shipped overseas , ” confided General Dreedle , square grizzled head bobbed sadistic laughter fiendish idea . “ That ’ one reasons I never let sight , ’ get woman . Can imagine poor son bitch going ? ” “ I ’ bed woman since shipped overseas , ” Colonel Moodus whimpered tearfully . “ Can imagine I ’ going ? ” General Dreedle could intransigent anyone else displeased Colonel Moodus . He taste sham , tact pretension , credo professional soldier unified concise : believed young men took orders willing give lives ideals , aspirations idiosyncrasies old men took orders . The officers enlisted men command identity military quantities . All asked work ; beyond , free whatever pleased . They free , Colonel Cathcart free , force men fly sixty missions chose , free , Yossarian free , stand formation naked wanted , although General Dreedle ’ granite jaw swung open sight went striding dictatorially right line make certain really man wearing nothing moccasins waiting attention ranks receive medal . General Dreedle speechless . Colonel Cathcart began faint spied Yossarian , Colonel Korn stepped behind squeezed arm strong grip . The silence grotesque . A steady warm wind flowed beach , old cart filled dirty straw rumbled view main road , drawn black donkey driven farmer flopping hat faded brown work clothes paid attention formal military ceremony taking place small field right . At last General Dreedle spoke . “ Get back car , ” snapped shoulder nurse , followed line . The nurse toddled away smile toward brown staff car , parked twenty yards away edge rectangular clearing . General Dreedle waited austere silence car door slammed demanded , “ Which one ? ” Colonel Moodus checked roster . “ This one Yossarian , Dad . He gets Distinguished Flying Cross. ” “ Well , I ’ damned , ” mumbled General Dreedle , ruddy monolithic face softened amusement . “ Why ’ wearing clothes , Yossarian ? ” “ I ’ want to. ” “ What mean ’ want ? Why hell ’ want ? ” “ I ’ want , sir. ” “ Why ’ wearing clothes ? ” General Dreedle demanded shoulder Colonel Cathcart . “ He ’ talking , ” Colonel Korn whispered Colonel Cathcart ’ shoulder behind , jabbing elbow sharply Colonel Cathcart ’ back . “ Why ’ wearing clothes ? ” Colonel Cathcart demanded Colonel Korn look acute pain , tenderly nursing spot Colonel Korn jabbed . “ Why ’ wearing clothes ? ” Colonel Korn demanded Captain Piltchard Captain Wren . “ A man killed plane Avignon last week bled , ” Captain Wren replied . “ He swears ’ never going wear uniform again. ” “ A man killed plane Avignon last week bled , ” Colonel Korn reported directly General Dreedle . “ His uniform ’ come back laundry yet. ” “ Where uniforms ? ” “ They ’ laundry , too. ” “ What underwear ? ” General Dreedle demanded . “ All underwear ’ laundry , , ” answered Colonel Korn . “ That sounds like lot crap , ” General Dreedle declared . “ It lot crap , sir , ” Yossarian said . “ Don ’ worry , sir , ” Colonel Cathcart promised General Dreedle threatening look Yossarian . “ You personal word man severely punished. ” “ What hell I care ’ punished ? ” General Dreedle replied surprise irritation . “ He ’ medal . If wants receive without clothes , hell business ? ” “ Those sentiments exactly , sir ! ” Colonel Cathcart echoed resounding enthusiasm mopped brow damp white handkerchief . “ But would say , sir , even light General Peckem ’ recent memorandum subject appropriate military attire combat areas ? ” “ Peckem ? ” General Dreedle ’ face clouded . “ Yes , sir , sir , ” said Colonel Cathcart obsequiously . “ General Peckem even recommends send men combat full-dress uniform ’ make good impression enemy ’ shot down. ” “ Peckem ? ” repeated General Dreedle , still squinting bewilderment . “ Just hell Peckem ? ” Colonel Korn jabbed Colonel Cathcart sharply back elbow . “ Absolutely nothing , sir ! ” Colonel Cathcart responded sprucely , wincing extreme pain gingerly rubbing spot Colonel Korn jabbed . “ And ’ exactly I decided take absolutely action I first opportunity discuss . Shall ignore completely , sir ? ” General Dreedle ignored completely , turning away baleful scorn hand Yossarian medal case . “ Get girl back car , ” commanded Colonel Moodus crabbily , waited one spot scowling face nurse rejoined . “ Get word office right away kill directive I issued ordering men wear neckties combat missions , ” Colonel Cathcart whispered Colonel Korn urgently corner mouth . “ I told , ” Colonel Korn snickered . “ But ’ listen me. ” “ Shhhh ! ” Colonel Cathcart cautioned . “ Goddammit , Korn , back ? ” Colonel Korn snickered . General Dreedle ’ nurse always followed General Dreedle everywhere went , even briefing room mission Avignon , stood asinine smile side platform bloomed like fertile oasis General Dreedle ’ shoulder pink-and-green uniform . Yossarian looked fell love , desperately . His spirits sank , leaving empty inside numb . He sat gazing clammy want full red lips dimpled cheeks listened Major Danby describe monotonous , didactic male drone heavy concentrations flak awaiting Avignon , moaned deep despair suddenly thought might never see lovely woman never spoken word loved pathetically . He throbbed ached sorrow , fear desire stared ; beautiful . He worshiped ground stood . He licked parched , thirsting lips sticky tongue moaned misery , loudly enough time attract startled , searching glances men sitting around rows crude wooden benches chocolate-colored coveralls stitched white parachute harnesses . Nately turned quickly alarm . “ What ? ” whispered . “ What ’ matter ? ” Yossarian hear . He sick lust mesmerized regret . General Dreedle ’ nurse little chubby , senses stuffed congestion yellow radiance hair unfelt pressure soft short fingers , rounded , untasted wealth nubile breasts Army-pink shirt opened wide throat rolling , ripened , triangular confluences belly thighs tight , slick forest-green gabardine officer ’ pants . He drank insatiably head painted toenail . He never wanted lose . “ Oooooooooooooh , ” moaned , time whole room rippled quavering , drawn-out cry . A wave startled uneasiness broke officers dais , even Major Danby , begun synchronizing watches , distracted momentarily counted seconds almost begin . Nately followed Yossarian ’ transfixed gaze long frame auditorium came General Dreedle ’ nurse . He blanched trepidation guessed troubling Yossarian . “ Cut , ? ” Nately warned fierce whisper . “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Yossarian moaned fourth time , time loudly enough everyone hear distinctly . “ Are crazy ? ” Nately hissed vehemently . “ You ’ get trouble. ” “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Dunbar answered Yossarian opposite end room . Nately recognized Dunbar ’ voice . The situation control , turned away small moan . “ Ooh. ” “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Dunbar moaned back . “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Nately moaned loud exasperation realized moaned . “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” Dunbar moaned back . “ Ooooooooooooooooooooh , ” someone entirely new chimed another section room , Nately ’ hair stood end . Yossarian Dunbar replied Nately cringed hunted futilely hole hide take Yossarian . A sprinkling people smothering laughter . An elfin impulse possessed Nately moaned intentionally next time lull . Another new voice answered . The flavor disobedience titillating , Nately moaned deliberately , next time could squeeze one edgewise . Still another new voice echoed . The room boiling irrepressibly bedlam . An eerie hubbub voices rising . Feet scuffled , things began drop people ’ fingers-pencils , computers , map cases , clattering steel flak helmets . A number men moaning giggling openly , telling far unorganized insurrection moaning might gone General Dreedle come forward quell , stepping determinedly center platform directly front Major Danby , , earnest , persevering head , still concentrating wrist watch saying , “ …twenty-five seconds… twenty… fifteen… ” General Dreedle ’ great , red domineering face gnarled perplexity oaken awesome resolution . “ That , men , ” ordered tersely , eyes glaring disapproval square jaw firm , ’ . “ I run fighting outfit , ” told sternly , room grown absolutely quiet men benches cowering sheepishly , “ ’ moaning group long I ’ command .

Can ’ hear ? ” “ Yes , sir ! ” Colonel Cathcart responded smartly , swallowing hard , turned brisk manner chauffeur meteorologist . “ Take Major Danby shoot him. ” “ S-sir ? ” chauffeur meteorologist stammered . “ I said take Major Danby shoot , ” Colonel Cathcart snapped . “ Can ’ hear ? ” The two young lieutenants nodded lumpishly gaped stunned flaccid reluctance , waiting initiate procedure taking Major Danby outside shooting . Neither ever taken Major Danby outside shot . They inched way dubiously toward Major Danby opposite sides . Major Danby white fear . His legs collapsed suddenly began fall , two young lieutenants sprang forward seized arms save slumping floor . Now Major Danby , rest seemed easy , guns . Major Danby began cry . Colonel Cathcart wanted rush side comfort , want look like sissy front General Dreedle . He remembered Appleby Havermeyer always brought their.45 automatics missions , began scan rows men search . As soon Major Danby began cry , Colonel Moodus , vacillating wretchedly sidelines , could restrain longer stepped diffidently toward General Dreedle sickly air self-sacrifice . “ I think ’ better wait minute , Dad , ” suggested hesitantly . “ I ’ think shoot him. ” General Dreedle infuriated intervention . “ Who hell says I ’ ? ” thundered pugnaciously voice loud enough rattle whole building . Colonel Moodus , face flushing embarrassment , bent close whisper ear . “ Why hell ’ I ? ” General Dreedle bellowed . Colonel Moodus whispered . “ You mean I ’ shoot anyone I want ? ” General Dreedle demanded uncompromising indignation . He pricked ears interest Colonel Moodus continued whispering . “ Is fact ? ” inquired , rage tamed curiosity . “ Yes , Dad .

Colonel Moodus turned crimson . “ No , Dad , ’ t- “ “ All right , let insubordinate son bitch go , ” General Dreedle snarled , turning bitterly away son-in-law barking peevishly Colonel Cathcart ’ chauffeur Colonel Cathcart ’ meteorologist . “ But get building keep . And let ’ continue goddam briefing war ends . I ’ never seen much incompetence. ” Colonel Cathcart nodded lamely General Dreedle signaled men hurriedly push Major Danby outside building .

He begin moaning aloud Colonel Korn came rescue stepping forward taking control .

He sat moment hangdog look , spurted feet suddenly stamped away another impetuous crack persuading Doc Daneeka ground , knocking Yossarian ’ washstand hip lurched around tripping fuel line stove Orr still constructing . Doc Daneeka withstood Dobbs ’ blustering gesticulating attack series impatient nods sent medical tent describe symptoms Gus Wes , painted gums purple gentian-violet solution moment started talk . They painted toes purple , , forced laxative throat opened mouth complain , sent away . Dobbs even worse shape Hungry Joe , could least fly missions nightmares . Dobbs almost bad Orr , seemed happy undersized , grinning lark deranged galvanic giggle shivering warped buck teeth sent along rest leave Milo Yossarian trip Cairo eggs Milo bought cotton instead took dawn Istanbul plane packed gun turrets exotic spiders unripened red bananas . Orr one homeliest freaks Yossarian ever encountered , one attractive . He raw bulgy face , hazel eyes squeezing sockets like matching brown halves marbles thick , wavy particolored hair sloping peak top head like pomaded pup tent . Orr knocked water engine shot almost every time went , began jerking Yossarian ’ arm like wild man taken Naples come Sicily find scheming , cigar-smoking , ten-year-old pimp two twelve-year-old virgin sisters waiting town front hotel room Milo . Yossarian pulled back Orr adamantly , gazing concern bewilderment Mt . Etna instead Mt . Vesuvius wondering Sicily instead Naples Orr kept entreating tittering , stuttering , concupiscent turmoil go along behind scheming ten-year-old pimp two twelve-year-old virgin sisters really virgins really sisters really twenty-eight . “ Go , ” Milo instructed Yossarian laconically . “ Remember mission. ” “ All right , ” Yossarian yielded sigh , remembering mission . “ But least let try find hotel room first I get good night ’ sleep afterward. ” “ You ’ get good night ’ sleep girls , ” Milo replied air intrigue .

Yossarian never laid eyes anything bare . The pimp spun turban high finger like trophy kept skipping inches ahead finger tips led tantalizing circle around square congested people howling laughter pointing Yossarian derision Milo strode grim look haste puckered lips reprovingly unseemly spectacle much vice frivolity . Milo insisted leaving Malta . “ We ’ sleepy , ” Orr whined . “ That ’ fault , ” Milo censured selfrighteously . “ If spent night hotel room instead immoral girls , ’ feel good I today. ” “ You told us go , ” Yossarian retorted accusingly . “ And ’ hotel room . You one could get hotel room. ” “ That ’ fault , either , ” Milo explained haughtily . “ How I supposed know buyers would town chick-pea harvest ? ” “ You knew , ” Yossarian charged . “ That explains ’ Sicily instead Naples .

What else ’ understand ? ” Yossarian riding beside co-pilot ’ seat . “ I ’ understand buy eggs seven cents apiece Malta sell five cents. ” “ I make profit. ” “ But make profit ? You lose two cents egg. ” “ But I make profit three quarter cents egg selling four quarter cents egg people Malta I buy seven cents egg . Of course , I ’ make profit . The syndicate makes profit . And everybody share. ” Yossarian felt beginning understand . “ And people sell eggs four quarter cents apiece make profit two three quarter cents apiece sell back seven cents apiece . Is right ?

Shame even thinking horrible thought. ” “ But Milo , ” Major Danby interrupted timidly , “ ’ war Germany , German planes. ” “ They thing ! ” Milo retorted furiously . “ Those planes belong syndicate , everybody share . Confiscate ? How possibly confiscate private property ? Confiscate , indeed ! I ’ never heard anything depraved whole life. ” And sure enough , Milo right , looked , mechanics painted German swastikas wings , tails fuselages double coats flat white stenciled words M amp ; M ENTERPRISES , FINE FRUITS AND PRODUCE . Right eyes transformed syndicate international cartel . Milo ’ argosies plenty filled air . Planes poured Norway , Denmark , France , Germany , Austria , Italy , Yugoslavia , Romania , Bulgaria , Sweden , Finland , Poland-from everywhere Europe , fact , Russia , Milo refused business . When everybody going signed M amp ; M Enterprises , Fine Fruits Produce , Milo created wholly owned subsidiary , M amp ; M Fancy Pastry , obtained airplanes money mess funds scones crumpets British Isles , prune cheese Danish Copenhagen , éclairs , cream puffs , Napoleons petits fours Paris , Reims Grenoble , Kugelhopf , pumpernickel Pfefferkuchen Berlin , Linzer Dobos Torten Vienna , Strudel Hungary baklava Ankara . Each morning Milo sent planes aloft Europe North Africa hauling long red tow signs advertising day ’ specials large square letters : “ EYEROUND , 79¢… WHITING , 21¢. ” He boosted cash income syndicate leasing tow signs Pet Milk , Gaines Dog Food , Noxzema . In spirit civic enterprise , regularly allotted certain amount free aerial advertising space General Peckem propagation messages public interest NEATNESS COUNTS , HASTE MAKES WASTE , THE FAMILY THAT PRAYS TOGETHER STAYS TOGETHER . Milo purchased spot radio announcements Axis Sally ’ Lord Haw Haw ’ daily propaganda broadcasts Berlin keep things moving . Business boomed every battlefront . Milo ’ planes familiar sight . They freedom passage everywhere , one day Milo contracted American military authorities bomb German-held highway bridge Orvieto German military authorities defend highway bridge Orvieto antiaircraft fire attack . His fee attacking bridge America total cost operation plus six per cent fee Germany defending bridge cost-plus-six agreement augmented merit bonus thousand dollars every American plane shot . The consummation deals represented important victory private enterprise , pointed , since armies countries socialized institutions . Once contracts signed , seemed point using resources syndicate bomb defend bridge , inasmuch governments ample men material right perfectly happy contribute , end Milo realized fantastic profit halves project nothing signing name twice . The arrangements fair sides . Since Milo freedom passage everywhere , planes able steal sneak attack without alerting German antiaircraft gunners ; since Milo knew attack , able alert German antiaircraft gunners sufficient time begin firing accurately moment planes came range . It ideal arrangement everyone dead man Yossarian ’ tent , killed target day arrived . “ I ’ kill ! ” Milo kept replying passionately Yossarian ’ angry protest . “ I ’ even day , I tell . Do think I ground firing antiaircraft gun planes came ? ” “ But organized whole thing , ’ ? ” Yossarian shouted back velvet darkness cloaking path leading past still vehicles motor pool open-air movie theater . “ And I ’ organize anything , ” Milo answered indignantly , drawing great agitated sniffs air hissing , pale , twitching nose . “ The Germans bridge , going bomb , whether I stepped picture . I saw wonderful opportunity make profit mission , I took . What ’ terrible ? ” “ What ’ terrible ? Milo , man tent killed mission could even unpack bags. ” “ But I ’ kill him. ” “ You got thousand dollars extra it. ” “ But I ’ kill . I ’ even , I tell . I Barcelona buying olive oil skinless boneless sardines , I ’ got purchase orders prove . And I ’ get thousand dollars . That thousand dollars went syndicate , everybody got share , even you. ” Milo appealing Yossarian bottom soul . “ Look , I ’ start war , Yossarian , matter lousy Wintergreen saying . I ’ trying put businesslike basis . Is anything wrong ? You know , thousand dollars ’ bad price medium bomber crew . If I persuade Germans pay thousand dollars every plane shoot , ’ I take ? ” “ Because ’ dealing enemy , ’ . Can ’ understand ’ fighting war ? People dying . Look around , Christ ’ sake ! ” Milo shook head weary forbearance . “ And Germans enemies , ” declared . “ Oh I know ’ going say . Sure , ’ war . But Germans also members good standing syndicate , ’ job protect rights shareholders . Maybe start war , maybe killing millions people , pay bills lot promptly allies I could name . Don ’ understand I respect sanctity contract Germany ? Can ’ see point view ? ” “ No , ” Yossarian rebuffed harshly . Milo stung made effort disguise wounded feelings . It muggy , moonlit night filled gnats , moths , mosquitoes . Milo lifted arm suddenly pointed toward open-air theater , milky , dust-filled beam bursting horizontally projector slashed conelike swath blackness draped fluorescent membrane light audience tilted seats hypnotic sags , faces focused upward toward aluminized movie screen . Milo ’ eyes liquid integrity , artless uncorrupted face lustrous shining mixture sweat insect repellent . “ Look , ” exclaimed voice choked emotion . “ They ’ friends , countrymen , comrades arms . A fellow never better bunch buddies . Do think I ’ single thing harm I ’ ? Haven ’ I got enough mind ? Can ’ see upset I already cotton piling piers Egypt ? ” Milo ’ voice splintered fragments , clutched Yossarian ’ shirt front though drowning . His eyes throbbing visibly like brown caterpillars . “ Yossarian , I going much cotton ? It ’ fault letting buy it. ” The cotton piling piers Egypt , nobody wanted . Milo never dreamed Nile Valley could fertile would market crop bought . The mess halls syndicate would help ; rose uncompromising rebellion proposal tax per capita basis order enable man share Egyptian cotton crop . Even reliable friends Germans failed crisis : preferred ersatz . Milo ’ mess halls would even help store cotton , warehousing costs skyrocketed contributed devastating drain upon cash reserves . The profits Orvieto mission sucked away . He began writing home money sent back better days ; soon almost gone . And new bales cotton kept arriving wharves Alexandria every day . Each time succeeded dumping world market loss snapped canny Egyptian brokers Levant , sold back original price , really worse . M amp ; M Enterprises verged collapse . Milo cursed hourly monumental greed stupidity purchasing entire Egyptian cotton crop , contract contract honored , one night , sumptuous evening meal , Milo ’ fighters bombers took , joined formation directly overhead began dropping bombs group . He landed another contract Germans , time bomb outfit . Milo ’ planes separated well co-ordinated attack bombed fuel stocks ordnance dump , repair hangars B-25 bombers resting lollipop-shaped hardstands field . His crews spared landing strip mess halls could land safely work done enjoy hot snack retiring . They bombed landing lights , since one shooting back . They bombed four squadrons , officers ’ club Group Headquarters building . Men bolted tents sheer terror know direction turn . Wounded soon lay screaming everywhere . A cluster fragmentation bombs exploded yard officers ’ club punched jagged holes side wooden building bellies backs row lieutenants captains standing bar . They doubled agony dropped . The rest officers fled toward two exits panic jammed doorways like dense , howling dam human flesh shrank going farther . Colonel Cathcart clawed elbowed way unruly , bewildered mass stood outside . He stared sky stark astonishment horror . Milo ’ planes , ballooning serenely blossoming treetops bomb bay doors open wing flaps monstrous , bug-eyed , blinding , fiercely flickering , eerie landing lights , apocalyptic sight ever beheld . Colonel Cathcart let go stricken gasp dismay hurled headlong jeep , almost sobbing . He found gas pedal ignition sped toward airfield fast rocking car would carry , huge flabby hands clenched bloodless wheel blaring horn tormentedly . Once almost killed swerved banshee screech tires avoid plowing bunch men running crazily toward hills underwear stunned faces thin arms pressed high around temples puny shields . Yellow , orange red fires burning sides road . Tents trees flames , Milo ’ planes kept coming around interminably blinking white landing lights bomb bay doors open . Colonel Cathcart almost turned jeep slammed brakes control tower . He leaped car still skidding dangerously hurtled flight steps inside , three men busy instruments controls . He bowled two aside lunge nickel-plated microphone , eyes glittering wildly beefy face contorted stress . He squeezed microphone bestial grip began shouting hysterically top voice . “ Milo , son bitch ! Are crazy ? What hell ? Come ! Come ! ” “ Stop hollering much , ? ” answered Milo , standing right beside control tower microphone . “ I ’ right here. ” Milo looked reproof turned back work . “ Very good , men , good , ” chanted microphone . “ But I see one supply shed still standing . That never , Purvis-I ’ spoken kind shoddy work . Now , go right back minute try . And time come slowly… slowly . Haste makes waste , Purvis . Haste makes waste . If I ’ told , I must told hundred times . Haste makes waste. ” The loudspeaker overhead began squawking . “ Milo , Alvin Brown . I ’ finished dropping bombs . What I ? ” “ Strafe , ” said Milo . “ Strafe ? ” Alvin Brown shocked . “ We choice , ” Milo informed resignedly . “ It ’ contract. ” “ Oh , okay , , ” Alvin Brown acquiesced . “ In case I ’ strafe. ” This time Milo gone far . Bombing men planes even phlegmatic observer could stomach , looked like end . High-ranking government officials poured investigate . Newspapers inveighed Milo glaring headlines , Congressmen denounced atrocity stentorian wrath clamored punishment . Mothers children service organized militant groups demanded revenge . Not one voice raised defense . Decent people everywhere affronted , Milo washed opened books public disclosed tremendous profit made . He could reimburse government people property destroyed still enough money left continue buying Egyptian cotton . Everybody , course , owned share . And sweetest part whole deal really need reimburse government . “ In democracy , government people , ” Milo explained . “ We ’ people , ’ ? So might well keep money eliminate middleman . Frankly , I ’ like see government get war altogether leave whole field private industry . If pay government everything owe , ’ encouraging government control discouraging individuals bombing men planes . We ’ taking away incentive. ” Milo correct , course , everyone soon agreed embittered misfits like Doc Daneeka , sulked cantankerously muttered offensive insinuations morality whole venture Milo mollified donation , name syndicate , lightweight aluminum collapsible garden chair Doc Daneeka could fold conveniently carry outside tent time Chief White Halfoat came inside tent carry back inside tent time Chief White Halfoat came . Doc Daneeka lost head Milo ’ bombardment ; instead running cover , remained open performed duty , slithering along ground shrapnel , strafing incendiary bombs like furtive , wily lizard casualty casualty , administering tourniquets , morphine , splints sulfanilamide dark doleful visage , never saying one word reading man ’ bluing wound dreadful portent decay . He worked relentlessly exhaustion long night came snife next day sent hurrying querulously medical tent temperature taken Gus Wes obtain mustard plaster vaporizer . Doc Daneeka tended moaning man night glum profound introverted grief showed airfield day Avignon mission Yossarian climbed steps plane naked , state utter shock , Snowden smeared abundantly bare heels toes , knees , arms fingers , pointed inside wordlessly toward young radio-gunner lay freezing death floor beside still younger tail-gunner kept falling back dead faint time opened eyes saw Snowden dying . Doc Daneeka draped blanket around Yossarian ’ shoulders almost tenderly Snowden removed plane carried ambulance stretcher . He led Yossarian toward jeep . McWatt helped , three drove silence squadron medical tent , McWatt Doc Daneeka guided Yossarian inside chair washed Snowden cold wet balls absorbent cotton . Doc Daneeka gave pill shot put sleep twelve hours . When Yossarian woke went see , Doc Daneeka gave another pill shot put sleep another twelve hours . When Yossarian woke went see , Doc Daneeka made ready give another pill shot . “ How long going keep giving pills shots ? ” Yossarian asked . “ Until feel better. ” “ I feel right now. ” Doc Daneeka ’ frail suntanned forehead furrowed surprise . “ Then ’ put clothes ? Why walking around naked ? ” “ I ’ want wear uniform more. ” Doc Daneeka accepted explanation put away hypodermic syringe . “ Are sure feel right ? ” “ I feel fine . I ’ little logy pills shots ’ giving me. ” Yossarian went business clothes rest day still naked late next morning Milo , hunting everywhere else , finally found sitting tree small distance back quaint little military cemetery Snowden buried . Milo dressed customary business attire-olive-drab trousers , fresh olive-drab shirt tie , one silver first lieutenant ’ bar gleaming collar , regulation dress cap stiff leather bill . “ I ’ looking , ” Milo called Yossarian ground reproachfully . “ You looked tree , ” Yossarian answered . “ I ’ morning. ” “ Come taste tell ’ good . It ’ important. ” Yossarian shook head . He sat nude lowest limb tree balanced hands grasping bough directly . He refused budge , Milo choice stretch arms trunk distasteful hug start climbing . He struggled upward clumsily loud grunts wheezes , clothes squashed crooked time pulled high enough hook leg limb pause breath . His dress cap askew danger falling . Milo caught time began slipping . Globules perspiration glistened like transparent pearls around mustache swelled like opaque blisters eyes . Yossarian watched impassively . Cautiously Milo worked around half circle could face Yossarian . He unwrapped tissue paper something soft , round brown handed Yossarian . “ Please taste let know think . I ’ like serve men. ” “ What ? ” asked Yossarian , took big bite . “ Chocolate-covered cotton. ” Yossarian gagged convulsively sprayed big mouthful chocolate-covered cotton right Milo ’ face . “ Here , take back ! ” spouted angrily . “ Jesus Christ ! Have gone crazy ? You ’ even take goddam seeds out. ” “ Give chance , ? ” Milo begged . “ It ’ bad . Is really bad ? ” “ It ’ even worse. ” “ But I ’ got make mess halls feed men. ” “ They ’ never able swallow it. ” “ They ’ got swallow , ” Milo ordained dictatorial grandeur , almost broke neck let go one arm wave righteous finger air . “ Come , ” Yossarian invited . “ You ’ much safer , see everything. ” Gripping bough hands , Milo began inching way limb sideways utmost care apprehension . His face rigid tension , sighed relief found seated securely beside Yossarian . He stroked tree affectionately . “ This pretty good tree , ” observed admiringly proprietary gratitude . “ It ’ tree life , ” Yossarian answered , waggling toes , “ knowledge good evil , too. ” Milo squinted closely bark branches . “ No ’ , ” replied . “ It ’ chestnut tree . I ought know . I sell chestnuts. ” “ Have way. ” They sat tree without talking several seconds , legs dangling hands almost straight bough , one completely nude pair crepe-soled sandals , completely dressed coarse olive-drab woolen uniform tie knotted tight . Milo studied Yossarian diffidently corner eye , hesitating tactfully . “ I want ask something , ” said last . “ You ’ clothes . I ’ want butt anything , I want know . Why ’ wearing uniform ? ” “ I ’ want to. ” Milo nodded rapidly like sparrow pecking . “ I see , I see , ” stated quickly look vivid confusion . “ I understand perfectly . I heard Appleby Captain Black say gone crazy , I wanted find out. ” He hesitated politely , weighing next question . “ Aren ’ ever going put uniform ? ” “ I ’ think so. ” Milo nodded spurious vim indicate still understood sat silent , ruminating gravely troubled misgiving . A scarlet-crested bird shot , brushing sure dark wings quivering bush . Yossarian Milo covered bower tissue-thin tiers sloping green largely surrounded gray chestnut trees silver spruce . The sun high overhead vast sapphire-blue sky beaded low , isolated , puffy clouds dry immaculate white . There breeze , leaves hung motionless . The shade feathery . Everything peace Milo , straightened suddenly muffled cry began pointing excitedly . “ Look ! ” exclaimed alarm . “ Look ! That ’ funeral going . That looks like cemetery . Isn ’ ? ” Yossarian answered slowly level voice . “ They ’ burying kid got killed plane Avignon day . Snowden. ” “ What happened ? ” Milo asked voice deadened awe . “ He got killed. ” “ That ’ terrible , ” Milo grieved , large brown eyes filled tears . “ That poor kid . It really terrible. ” He bit trembling lip hard , voice rose emotion continued . “ And get even worse mess halls ’ agree buy cotton . Yossarian , ’ matter ? Don ’ realize ’ syndicate ? Don ’ know ’ got share ? ” “ Did dead man tent share ? ” Yossarian demanded caustically . “ Of course , ” Milo assured lavishly . “ Everybody squadron share. ” “ He killed even got squadron. ” Milo made deft grimace tribulation turned away . “ I wish ’ stop picking dead man tent , ” pleaded peevishly . “ I told I ’ anything killing . Is fault I saw great opportunity corner market Egyptian cotton got us trouble ? Was I supposed know going glut ? I ’ even know glut days . An opportunity corner market ’ come along often , I pretty shrewd grab chance I it. ” Milo gulped back moan saw six uniformed pallbearers lift plain pine coffin ambulance set gently ground beside yawning gash freshly dug grave . “ And I ’ get rid single penny ’ worth , ” mourned . Yossarian unmoved fustian charade burial ceremony , Milo ’ crushing bereavement . The chaplain ’ voice floated distance tenuously unintelligible , almost inaudible monotone , like gaseous murmur . Yossarian could make Major Major towering lanky aloofness thought recognized Major Danby mopping brow handkerchief . Major Danby stopped shaking since run-in General Dreedle . There strands enlisted men molded curve around three officers , inflexible lumps wood , four idle gravediggers streaked fatigues lounging indifferently spades near shocking , incongruous heap loose copperred earth . As Yossarian stared , chaplain elevated gaze toward Yossarian beatifically , pressed fingers eyeballs manner affliction , peered upward toward Yossarian searchingly , bowed head , concluding Yossarian took climactic part funeral rite . The four men fatigues lifted coffin slings lowered grave . Milo shuddered violently . “ I ’ watch , ” cried , turning away anguish . “ I ’ sit watch mess halls let syndicate die. ” He gnashed teeth shook head bitter woe resentment . “ If loyalty , would buy cotton till hurts keep right buying cotton till hurts . They would build fires burn underwear summer uniforms create bigger demand . But ’ thing . Yossarian , try eating rest chocolate-covered cotton . Maybe taste delicious now. ” Yossarian pushed hand away . “ Give , Milo . People ’ eat cotton. ” Milo ’ face narrowed cunningly . “ It ’ really cotton , ” coaxed . “ I joking . It ’ really cotton candy , delicious cotton candy . Try see. ” “ Now ’ lying. ” “ I never lie ! ” Milo rejoindered proud dignity . “ You ’ lying now. ” “ I lie ’ necessary , ” Milo explained defensively , averting eyes moment blinking lashes winningly . “ This stuff better cotton candy , really . It ’ made real cotton . Yossarian , ’ got help make men eat . Egyptian cotton finest cotton world. ” “ But ’ indigestible , ” Yossarian emphasized . “ It make sick , ’ understand ? Why ’ try living ’ believe ? ” “ I try , ” admitted Milo gloomily . “ And made sick. ” The graveyard yellow hay green cooked cabbage . In little chaplain stepped back , beige crescent human forms began break sluggishly , like flotsam . The men drifted without haste sound vehicles parked along side bumpy dirt road . With heads disconsolately , chaplain , Major Major Major Danby moved toward jeeps ostracized group , holding friendlessly several feet away two . “ It ’ , ” observed Yossarian . “ It ’ end , ” Milo agreed despondently . “ There ’ hope left . And I left free make decisions . That teach lesson discipline next time I try something like this. ” “ Why ’ sell cotton government ? ” Yossarian suggested casually , watched four men streaked fatigues shoveling heaping bladefuls copper-red earth back inside grave . Milo vetoed idea brusquely . “ It ’ matter principle , ” explained firmly . “ The government business business , I would last person world ever try involve government business mine . But business government business , ” remembered alertly , continued elation . “ Calvin Coolidge said , Calvin Coolidge President , must true . And government responsibility buying Egyptian cotton I ’ got one else wants I make profit , ’ ? ” Milo ’ face clouded almost abruptly , spirits descended state sad anxiety . “ But I get government ? ” “ Bribe , ” Yossarian said . “ Bribe ! ” Milo outraged almost lost balance broke neck . “ Shame ! ” scolded severely , breathing virtuous fire upward rusty mustache billowing nostrils prim lips . “ Bribery law , know . But ’ law make profit , ? So ’ law bribe someone order make fair profit , ? No , course ! ” He fell brooding , meek , almost pitiable distress . “ But I know bribe ? ” “ Oh , ’ worry , ” Yossarian comforted toneless snicker engines jeeps ambulance fractured drowsy silence vehicles rear began driving away backward . “ You make bribe big enough ’ find . Just make sure everything right open . Let everyone know exactly want much ’ willing pay . The first time act guilty ashamed , might get trouble. ” “ I wish ’ come , ” Milo remarked . “ I ’ feel safe among people take bribes . They ’ better bunch crooks. ” “ You ’ right , ” Yossarian assured confidence . “ If run trouble , tell everybody security country requires strong domestic Egyptian-cotton speculating industry. ” “ It , ” Milo informed solemnly . “ A strong Egyptian-cotton speculating industry means much stronger America. ” “ Of course . And ’ work , point great number American families depend income. ” “ A great many American families depend income. ” “ You see ? ” said Yossarian . “ You ’ much better I . You almost make sound true. ” “ It true , ” Milo exclaimed strong trace old hauteur . “ That ’ I mean . You right amount conviction. ” “ You ’ sure ’ come ? ” Yossarian shook head . Milo impatient get started . He stuffed remainder chocolate-covered cotton ball shirt pocket edged way back gingerly along branch smooth gray trunk . He threw arms trunk generous awkward embrace began shinnying , sides leather-soled shoes slipping constantly seemed many times would fall injure . Halfway , changed mind climbed back . Bits tree bark stuck mustache , straining face flushed exertion . “ I wish ’ put uniform instead going around naked way , ” confided pensively climbed back hurried away . “ You might start trend , I ’ never get rid goldarned cotton. ” 25 THE CHAPLAIN It already time since chaplain first begun wondering everything . Was God ? How could sure ? Being Anabaptist minister American Army difficult enough best circumstances ; without dogma , almost intolerable . People loud voices frightened . Brave , aggressive men action like Colonel Cathcart left feeling helpless alone . Wherever went Army , stranger . Enlisted men officers conduct conducted enlisted men officers , even chaplains friendly toward toward . In world success virtue , resigned failure . He painfully aware lacked ecclesiastical aplomb savoir-faire enabled many colleagues faiths sects get ahead . He equipped excel . He thought ugly wanted daily home wife . Actually , chaplain almost good-looking , pleasant , sensitive face pale brittle sandstone . His mind open every subject . Perhaps really Washington Irving , perhaps really signing Washington Irving ’ name letters knew nothing . Such lapses memory uncommon medical annals , knew . There way really knowing anything . He remembered distinctly-or impression remembered distinctly-his feeling met Yossarian somewhere first time met Yossarian lying bed hospital . He remembered experiencing disquieting sensation almost two weeks later Yossarian appeared tent ask taken combat duty . By time , course , chaplain met Yossarian somewhere , odd , unorthodox ward every patient seemed delinquent unfortunate patient covered head toe white bandages plaster found dead one day thermometer mouth . But chaplain ’ impression prior meeting occasion far momentous occult , significant encounter Yossarian remote , submerged perhaps even entirely spiritual epoch made identical , foredooming admission nothing , absolutely nothing , could help . Doubts kind gnawed chaplain ’ lean , suffering frame insatiably . Was single true faith , life death ? How many angels could dance head pin , matters God occupy infinite aeons Creation ? Why necessary put protective seal brow Cain people protect ? Did Adam Eve produce daughters ? These great , complex questions ontology tormented . Yet never seemed nearly crucial question kindness good manners . He pinched perspinngly epistemological dilemma skeptic , unable accept solutions problems unwilling dismiss unsolvable . He never without misery , never without hope . “ Have ever , ” inquired hesitantly Yossarian day tent Yossarian sat holding hands warm bottle Coca-Cola chaplain able solace , “ situation felt , even though knew experiencing first time ? ” Yossarian nodded perfunctorily , chaplain ’ breath quickened anticipation made ready join power Yossarian ’ prodigious effort rip away last voluminous black folds shrouding eternal mysteries existence . “ Do feeling ? ” Yossarian shook head explained déjà vu momentary infinitesimal lag operation two coactive sensory nerve centers commonly functioned simultaneously . The chaplain scarcely heard . He disappointed , inclined believe Yossarian , given sign , secret , enigmatic vision still lacked boldness divulge . There mistaking awesome implications chaplain ’ revelation : either insight divine origin hallucination ; either blessed losing mind . Both prospects filled equal fear depression . It neither déjà vu , presque vu jamais vu . It possible vus never heard one vus would explain succinctly bafing phenomenon witness part ; even possible none thought taken place , really taken place , dealing aberration memory rather perception , never really thought seen , impression thought merely illusion illusion , imagining ever imagined seeing naked man sitting tree cemetery . It obvious chaplain particularly well suited work , often speculated whether might happier serving branch service , private infantry field artillery , perhaps , even paratrooper . He real friends . Before meeting Yossarian , one group felt ease , hardly ease Yossarian , whose frequent rash insubordinate outbursts kept almost constantly edge ambiguous state enjoyable trepidation . The chaplain felt safe officers ’ club Yossarian Dunbar , even Nately McWatt . When sat need sit anyone else ; problem sit solved , protected undesired company fellow officers invariably welcomed excessive cordiality approached waited uncomfortably go away . He made many people uneasy . Everyone always friendly toward , one ever nice ; everyone spoke , one ever said anything . Yossarian Dunbar much relaxed , chaplain hardly uncomfortable . They even defended night Colonel Cathcart tried throw officers ’ club , Yossarian rising truculently intervene Nately shouting , “ Yossarian ! ” restrain . Colonel Cathcart turned white sheet sound Yossarian ’ name , , everyone ’ amazement , retreated horrified disorder bumped General Dreedle , elbowed away annoyance ordered right back order chaplain start coming officers ’ club every night . The chaplain almost much trouble keeping track status officers ’ club remembering ten mess halls group scheduled eat next meal . He would soon remained kicked officers ’ club , pleasure finding new companions . If chaplain go officers ’ club night , place else could go . He would pass time Yossarian ’ Dunbar ’ table shy , reticent smile , seldom speaking unless addressed , glass thick sweet wine almost untasted toyed unfamiliarly tiny corncob pipe affected selfconsciously occasionally stuffed tobacco smoked . He enjoyed listening Nately , whose maudlin , bittersweet lamentations mirrored much romantic desolation never failed evoke resurgent tides longing wife children . The chaplain would encourage Nately nods comprehension assent , amused candor immaturity . Nately glory immodestly girl prostitute , chaplain ’ awareness stemmed mainly Captain Black , never slouched past table without broad wink chaplain tasteless , wounding gibe Nately . The chaplain approve Captain Black found difficult wish evil . No one , even Nately , seemed really appreciate , Chaplain Robert Oliver Shipman , chaplain human , could charming , passionate , pretty wife loved almost insanely three small blue-eyed children strange , forgotten faces would grow someday regard freak might never forgive social embarrassment vocation would cause . Why ’ anybody understand really freak normal , lonely adult trying lead normal , lonely adult life ? If pricked , ’ bleed ? And tickled , ’ laugh ? It seemed never occurred , , eyes , hands , organs , dimensions , senses affections , wounded kind weapons , warmed cooled breezes fed kind food , although , forced concede , different mess hall successive meal . The person seem realize feelings Corporal Whitcomb , managed bruise going head Colonel Cathcart proposal sending form letters condolence home families men killed wounded combat . The chaplain ’ wife one thing world could certain , would sufficient , left live life children . The chaplain ’ wife reserved , diminutive , agreeable woman early thirties , dark attractive , narrow waist , calm intelligent eyes , small , bright , pointy teeth childlike face vivacious petite ; kept forgetting children looked like , time returned snapshots like seeing faces first time . The chaplain loved wife children tameless intensity often wanted sink ground helplessly weep like castaway cripple . He tormented inexorably morbid fantasies involving , dire , hideous omens illness accident . His meditations polluted threats dread diseases like Ewing ’ tumor leukemia ; saw infant son die two three times every week never taught wife stop arterial bleeding ; watched , tearful , paralyzed silence , whole family electrocuted , one , baseboard socket never told human body would conduct electricity ; four went flames almost every night water heater exploded set two-story wooden house afire ; ghastly , heartless , revolting detail saw poor dear wife ’ trim fragile body crushed viscous pulp brick wall market building half-wined drunken automobile driver watched hysterical five-year-old daughter led away grisly scene kindly middle-aged gentleman snow-white hair raped murdered repeatedly soon driven deserted sandpit , two younger children starved death slowly house wife ’ mother , baby-sitting , dropped dead heart attack news wife ’ accident given telephone . The chaplain ’ wife sweet , soothing , considerate woman , yearned touch warm flesh slender arm stroke smooth black hair , hear intimate , comforting voice . She much stronger person . He wrote brief , untroubled letters week , sometimes twice . He wanted write urgent love letters day long crowd endless pages desperate , uninhibited confessions humble worship need careful instructions administering artificial respiration . He wanted pour torrents self-pity unbearable loneliness despair warn never leave boric acid aspirin reach children cross street traffic light . He wish worry . The chaplain ’ wife intuitive , gentle , compassionate responsive . Almost inevitably , reveries reunion ended explicit acts love-making . The chaplain felt deceitful presiding funerals , would astonished learn apparition tree day manifestation Almighty ’ censure blasphemy pride inherent function . To simulate gravity , feign grief pretend supernatural intelligence hereafter fearsome arcane circumstance death seemed criminal offenses . He recalled-or almost convinced recalled-the scene cemetery perfectly . He could still see Major Major Major Danby standing somber broken stone pillars either side , see almost exact number enlisted men almost exact places stood , see four unmoving men spades , repulsive coffin large , loose , triumphant mound reddish-brown earth , massive , still , depthless , muffling sky , weirdly blank blue day almost poisonous . He would remember forever , part parcel extraordinary event ever befallen , event perhaps marvelous , perhaps pathological-the vision naked man tree . How could explain ? It already seen never seen , certainly almost seen ; neither déjà vu , jamais vu presque vu elastic enough cover . Was ghost , ? The dead man ’ soul ? An angel heaven minion hell ? Or whole fantastic episode merely figment diseased imagination , , deteriorating mind , rotting brain ? The possibility really naked man tree-two men , actually , since first joined shortly second man clad brown mustache sinister dark garments head toe bent forward ritualistically along limb tree offer first man something drink brown goblet-never crossed chaplain ’ mind . The chaplain sincerely helpful person never able help anyone , even Yossarian finally decided seize bull horns visit Major Major secretly learn , Yossarian said , men Colonel Cathcart ’ group really forced fly combat missions anyone else . It daring , impulsive move chaplain decided quarreling Corporal Whitcomb washing tepid canteen water joyless lunch Milky Way Baby Ruth . He went Major Major foot Corporal Whitcomb would see leaving , stealing forest noiselessly two tents clearing left behind , dropping inside abandoned railroad ditch , footing surer . He hurried along fossilized wooden ties accumulating mutinous anger . He browbeaten humiliated successively morning Colonel Cathcart , Colonel Korn Corporal Whitcomb . He make felt respect ! His slight chest soon puffing breath . He moved swiftly could without breaking run , fearing resolution might dissolve slowed . Soon saw uniformed figure coming toward rusted rails . He clambered immediately side ditch , ducked inside dense copse low trees concealment sped along original direction narrow , overgrown mossy path found winding deep inside shaded forest . It tougher going , plunged ahead reckless consuming determination , slipping stumbling often stinging unprotected hands stubborn branches blocking way bushes tall ferns sides spread open lurched past olive-drab military trailer cinder blocks clearly visible thinning underbrush . He continued past tent luminous pearl-gray cat sunning outside past another trailer cinder blocks burst clearing Yossarian ’ squadron . A salty dew formed lips . He pause , strode directly across clearing orderly room , welcomed gaunt , stoop-shouldered staff sergeant prominent cheekbones long , light blond hair , informed graciously could go right , since Major Major . The chaplain thanked curt nod proceeded alone aisle desks typewriters canvas partition rear . He bobbed triangular opening found inside empty office . The flap fell closed behind . He breathing hard sweating profusely . The office remained empty . He thought heard furtive whispering . Ten minutes passed . He looked stern displeasure , jaws clamped together indomitably , turned suddenly water remembered staff sergeant ’ exact words : could go right , since Major Major . The enlisted men playing practical joke ! The chaplain shrank back wall terror , bitter tears springing eyes . A pleading whimper escaped trembling lips . Major Major elsewhere , enlisted men room made butt inhuman prank . He could almost see waiting side canvas wall , bunched expectantly like pack greedy , gloating omnivorous beasts prey , ready barbaric mirth jeers pounce brutally moment reappeared . He cursed gullibility wished panic something like mask pair dark glasses false mustache disguise , forceful , deep voice like Colonel Cathcart ’ broad , muscular shoulders biceps enable step outside fearlessly vanquish malevolent persecutors overbearing authority self-confidence would make quail slink away cravenly repentance . He lacked courage face . The way window . The coast clear , chaplain jumped Major Major ’ office window , darted swiftly around corner tent , leaped inside railroad ditch hide . He scooted away body doubled face contorted intentionally nonchalant , sociable smile case anyone chanced see . He abandoned ditch forest moment saw someone coming toward opposite direction ran cluttered forest frenziedly like someone pursued , cheeks burning disgrace . He heard loud , wild peals derisive laughter crashing caught blurred glimpses wicked , beery faces smirking far back inside bushes high overhead foliage trees . Spasms scorching pains stabbed lungs slowed crippled walk . He lunged staggered onward could go farther collapsed gnarled apple tree , banging head hard trunk toppled forward holding arms keep falling . His breathing rasping , moaning din ears . Minutes passed like hours finally recognized source turbulent roar overwhelming . The pains chest abated . Soon felt strong enough stand . He cocked ears craftily . The forest quiet . There demonic laughter , one chasing . He tired sad dirty feel relieved . He straightened disheveled clothing fingers numb shaking walked rest way clearing rigid self-control . The chaplain brooded often danger heart attack . Corporal Whitcomb ’ jeep still parked clearing . The chaplain tiptoed stealthily around back Corporal Whitcomb ’ tent rather pass entrance risk seen insulted . Heaving grateful sigh , slipped quickly inside tent found Corporal Whitcomb ensconced cot , knees propped . Corporal Whitcomb ’ mud-caked shoes chaplain ’ blanket , eating one chaplain ’ candy bars thumbed sneering expression one chaplain ’ Bibles . “ Where ’ ? ” demanded rudely disinterestedly , without looking . The chaplain colored turned away evasively . “ I went walk woods. ” “ All right , ” Corporal Whitcomb snapped . “ Don ’ take confidence . But wait see happens morale. ” He bit chaplain ’ candy bar hungrily continued full mouth . “ You visitor gone . Major Major. ” The chaplain spun around surprise cried : “ Major Major ? Major Major ? ” “ That ’ ’ talking , ’ ? ” “ Where go ? ” “ He jumped railroad ditch took like frightened rabbit. ” Corporal Whitcomb snickered . “ What jerk ! ” “ Did say wanted ? ” “ He said needed help matter great importance. ” The chaplain astounded . “ Major Major said ? ” “ He ’ say , ” Corporal Whitcomb corrected withering precision . “ He wrote sealed personal letter left desk. ” The chaplain glanced bridge table served desk saw abominable orange-red pear-shaped plum tomato obtained morning Colonel Cathcart , still lying side forgotten like indestructible incamadine symbol ineptitude . “ Where letter ? ” “ I threw away soon I tore open read it. ” Corporal Whitcomb slammed Bible shut jumped . “ What ’ matter ? Won ’ take word ? ” He walked . He walked right back almost collided chaplain , rushing behind way back Major Major . “ You ’ know delegate responsibility , ” Corporal Whitcomb informed sullenly . “ That ’ another one things ’ wrong you. ” The chaplain nodded penitently hurried past , unable make take time apologize . He could feel skillful hand fate motivating imperatively . Twice day already , realized , Major Major come racing toward inside ditch ; twice day chaplain stupidly postponed destined meeting bolting forest . He seethed self-recrimination hastened back rapidly could stride along splintered , irregularly spaced railroad ties . Bits grit gravel inside shoes socks grinding tops toes raw . His pale , laboring face screwed unconsciously grimace acute discomfort . The early August afternoon growing hotter humid . It almost mile tent Yossarian ’ squadron . The chaplain ’ summer-tan shirt soaking perspiration time arrived rushed breathlessly back inside orderly room tent , halted peremptorily treacherous , soft-spoken staff sergeant round eyeglasses gaunt cheeks , requested remain outside Major Major inside told would allowed inside Major Major went . The chaplain looked uncomprehending daze . Why sergeant hate ? wondered . His lips white trembling . He aching thirst . What matter people ? Wasn ’ tragedy enough ? The sergeant put hand held chaplain steady . “ I ’ sorry , sir , ” said regretfully low , courteous , melancholy voice . “ But Major Major ’ orders . He never wants see anyone. ” “ He wants see , ” chaplain pleaded . “ He came tent see I before. ” “ Major Major ? ” sergeant asked . “ Yes , . Please go ask him. ” “ I ’ afraid I ’ go , sir . He never wants see either . Perhaps left note. ” “ I ’ want leave note . Doesn ’ ever make exception ? ” “ Only extreme circumstances . The last time left tent attend funeral one enlisted men .

In fact , advised Yossarian go see help . Are certain ’ like leave note , sir ? I pencil paper right here. ” The chaplain shook head , chewing clotted dry lower lip forlornly , walked . It still early day , much already happened . The air cooler forest . His throat parched sore . He walked slowly asked ruefully new misfortune could possibly befall moment mad hermit woods leaped without warning behind mulberry bush . The chaplain screamed top voice . The tall , cadaverous stranger fell back fright chaplain ’ cry shrieked , “ Don ’ hurt ! ” “ Who ? ” chaplain shouted . “ Please ’ hurt ! ” man shouted back . “ I ’ chaplain ! ” “ Then want hurt ? ” “ I ’ want hurt ! ” chaplain insisted rising hint exasperation , even though still rooted spot . “ Just tell want me. ” “ I want find Chief White Halfoat died pneumonia yet , ” man shouted back . “ That ’ I want .

A pair captain ’ bars ulcerated rust hung man ’ ragged shirt collar . He hairy , tar-black mole underside one nostril heavy rough mustache color poplar bark . “ Why live woods belong squadron ? ” chaplain inquired curiously . “ I live woods , ” captain replied crabbily , though chaplain ought know . He straightened slowly , still watching chaplain guardedly although towered full head . “ Don ’ hear everybody talking ? Chief White Halfoat swore going cut throat night I fast asleep , I ’ dare lie squadron ’ still alive. ” The chaplain listened implausible explanation distrustfully . “ But ’ incredible , ” replied . “ That would premeditated murder . Why ’ report incident Major Major ? ” “ I report incident Major Major , ” said captain sadly , “ Major Major said would cut throat I ever spoke again. ” The man studied chaplain fearfully . “ Are going cut throat , ? ” “ Oh , , , , ” chaplain assured . “ Of course . Do really live forest ? ” The captain nodded , chaplain gazed porous gray pallor fatigue malnutrition mixture pity esteem . The man ’ body bony shell inside rumpled clothing hung like disorderly collection sacks . Wisps dried grass glued ; needed haircut badly . There great , dark circles eyes . The chaplain moved almost tears harassed , bedraggled picture captain presented , filled deference compassion thought many severe rigors poor man endure daily . In voice hushed humility , said , “ Who laundry ? ” The captain pursed lips businesslike manner . “ I done washerwoman one farmhouses road . I keep things trailer sneak inside twice day clean handkerchief change underwear. ” “ What winter comes ? ” “ Oh , I expect back squadron , ” captain answered kind martyred confidence . “ Chief White Halfoat kept promising everyone going die pneumonia , I guess I ’ patient weather turns little colder damper. ” He scrutinized chaplain perplexedly . “ Don ’ know ?

So many monstrous events occurring longer positive events monstrous really taking place . He wanted find madman woods quickly possible , check ever really Captain Flume , first chore , recalled reluctance , appease Corporal Whitcomb neglecting delegate enough responsibility . He plodded along zigzagging path forest listlessly , clogged thirst feeling almost exhausted go . He remorseful thought Corporal Whitcomb .

In meantime , I ’ also like dream answers questions I asked . These sessions pleasant , know. ” “ I ’ mention Dunbar , ” Yossarian replied . “ Dunbar ? ” “ He ’ one started .

You ’ even know ’ hospital for. ” “ I ’ hospital wounded leg , ” Yossarian insisted . Major Sanderson ignored argument sarcastic laugh . “ Well , give regards friend Dunbar . And tell dream dream , ’ ? ” But Dunbar nausea dizziness constant headache inclined co-operate Major Sanderson . Hungry Joe nightmares finished sixty missions waiting go home , unwilling share came hospital visit . “ Hasn ’ anyone got dreams Major Sanderson ? ” Yossarian asked . “ I hate disappoint .

He suspects someone plotting transfer Pacific Ocean . All time ’ thinking coming help . When I told I needed help , wondered ’ chaplain I ’ go see. ” The chaplain waited patient dejection Yossarian Dunbar broke laughter . “ I used think immoral unhappy , ” continued , though keening aloud solitude . “ Now I ’ know think .

Fortiori rejoiced . “ They came ward told me. ” “ What ? ” Dunbar demanded petulantly doctors . “ You ? ” replied asperity . “ You ’ going Yossarian . Right back combat ! ” And back combat went . Yossarian enraged ambulance returned squadron , went limping justice Doc Daneeka , glared glumly misery disdain . “ You ! ” Doc Daneeka exclaimed mournfully accusing disgust , egg-shaped pouches eyes firm censorious . “ All ever think . Go take look bomb line want see ’ happening since went hospital. ” Yossarian startled . “ Are losing ? ” “ Losing ? ” Doc Daneeka cried . “ The whole military situation going hell ever since captured Paris . I knew would happen. ” He paused , sulking ire turning melancholy , frowned irritably though Yossarian ’ fault . “ American troops pushing German soil . The Russians captured back Romania . Only yesterday Greeks Eighth Army captured Rimini . The Germans defensive everywhere ! ” Doc Daneeka paused fortified huge breath piercing ejaculation grief . “ There ’ Luftwaffe left ! ” wailed . He seemed ready burst tears . “ The whole Gothic line danger collapsing ! ” “ So ? ” asked Yossarian . “ What ’ wrong ? ” “ What ’ wrong ? ” Doc Daneeka cried . “ If something ’ happen soon , Germany may surrender . And ’ sent Pacific ! ” Yossarian gawked Doc Daneeka grotesque dismay . “ Are crazy ? Do know ’ saying ? ” “ Yeah , ’ easy laugh , ” Doc Daneeka sneered . “ Who hell laughing ? ” “ At least ’ got chance . You ’ combat might get killed . But ? I ’ got nothing hope for. ” “ You ’ goddam head ! ” Yossarian shouted emphatically , seizing shirt front . “ Do know ?

Now take combat duty send home . They ’ going send crazy man killed , ? ” “ Who else go ? ” 28 DOBBS McWatt went , McWatt crazy . And Yossarian , still walking limp , Yossarian gone two times found menaced rumor another mission Bologna , limped determinedly Dobbs ’ tent early one warm afternoon , put finger mouth said , “ Shush ! ” “ What shushing ? ” asked Kid Sampson , peeling tangerine front teeth perused dog-eared pages comic book . “ He ’ even saying anything. ” “ Screw , ” said Yossarian Kid Sampson , jerking thumb back shoulder toward entrance tent . Kid Sampson cocked blond eyebrows discerningly rose co-operate . He whistled upward four times drooping yellow mustache spurted away hills dented old green motorcycle purchased secondhand months . Yossarian waited last faint bark motor died away distance . Things inside tent seem quite normal . The place neat . Dobbs watching curiously , smoking fat cigar . Now Yossarian made mind brave , deathly afraid . “ All right , ” said . “ Let ’ kill Colonel Cathcart . We ’ together. ” Dobbs sprang forward cot look wildest terror . “ Shush ! ” roared . “ Kill Colonel Cathcart ? What talking ? ” “ Be quiet , damn , ” Yossarian snarled . “ The whole island hear . Have still got gun ? ” “ Are crazy something ? ” shouted Dobbs . “ Why I want kill Colonel Cathcart ? ” “ Why ? ” Yossarian stared Dobbs incredulous scowl . “ Why ? It idea , ’ ? Didn ’ come hospital ask ? ” Dobbs smiled slowly . “ But I fifty-eight missions , ” explained , puffing cigar luxuriously . “ I ’ packed I ’ waiting go home . I ’ finished sixty missions. ” “ So ? ” Yossarian replied . “ He ’ going raise again. ” “ Maybe time ’ t. ” “ He always raises . What hell ’ matter , Dobbs ? Ask Hungry Joe many time ’ packed bags. ” “ I ’ got wait see happens , ” Dobbs maintained stubbornly . “ I ’ crazy get mixed something like I ’ combat. ” He flicked ash cigar . “ No , advice , ” remarked , “ fly sixty missions like rest us see happens. ” Yossarian resisted impulse spit squarely eye . “ I may live sixty , ” wheedled flat , pessimistic voice . “ There ’ rumor around volunteered group Bologna again. ” “ It ’ rumor , ” Dobbs pointed self-important air . “ You ’ believe every rumor hear. ” “ Will stop giving advice ? ” “ Why ’ speak Orr ? ” Dobbs advised . “ Orr got knocked water last week second mission Avignon . Maybe ’ unhappy enough kill him. ” “ Orr ’ got brains enough unhappy. ” Orr knocked water Yossarian still hospital eased crippled airplane gently glassy blue swells Marseilles flawless skill one member six-man crew suffered slightest bruise . The escape hatches front rear sections flew open sea still foaming white green around plane , men scrambled speedily could flaccid orange Mae West life jackets failed inflate dangled limp useless around necks waists . The life jackets failed inflate Milo removed twin carbon-dioxide cylinders inflating chambers make strawberry crushed-pineapple ice-cream sodas served officers ’ mess hall replaced mimeographed notes read : “ What ’ good M amp ; M Enterprises good country. ” Orr popped sinking airplane last . “ You seen ! ” Sergeant Knight roared laughter related episode Yossarian . “ It funniest goddam thing ever saw . None Mae Wests would work Milo stolen carbon dioxide make ice-cream sodas bastards getting officers ’ mess . But ’ bad , turned . Only one us ’ swim , lifted guy raft Orr worked rope right fuselage still standing plane . That little crackpot sure knack things like . Then raft came loose drifted away , six us wound sitting one elbows legs pressed close almost ’ move without knocking guy next raft water . The plane went three seconds left alone , right began unscrewing caps Mae Wests see hell gone wrong found goddam notes Milo telling us good good enough rest us . That bastard !

Next found bouillon cubes aluminum cups made us soup . Then found tea . Sure , made ! Can ’ see serving us tea sat soaking wet water ass ? Now I falling raft I laughing much . We laughing . And dead serious , except goofy giggle crazy grin . What jerk ! Whatever found used . He found shark repellent sprinkled right water . He found marker dye threw water . The next thing finds fishing line dried bait , face lights though Air-Sea Rescue launch sped save us died exposure Germans sent boat Spezia take us prisoner machine-gun us . In time , Orr fishing line water , trolling away happy lark . ‘ Lieutenant , expect catch ? ’ I asked . ‘ Cod , ’ told . And meant .

And ’ spent time launch picked us thirty minutes later , sitting baited fishing line behind , compass lap map spread knees , paddling away hard could dinky blue oar though speeding Majorca . Jesus ! ” Sergeant Knight knew Majorca , Orr , Yossarian told often sanctuaries Spain , Switzerland Sweden American fliers could interned duration war conditions utmost ease luxury merely flying . Yossarian squadron ’ leading authority internment already begun plotting emergency heading Switzerland every mission flew northernmost Italy . He would certainly preferred Sweden , level intelligence high could swim nude beautiful girls low , demurring voices sire whole happy , undisciplined tribes illegitimate Yossarians state would assist parturition launch life without stigma ; Sweden reach , far away , Yossarian waited piece flak would knock one engine Italian Alps provide excuse heading Switzerland . He would even tell pilot guiding . Yossarian often thought scheming pilot trusted fake crippled engine destroy evidence deception belly landing , pilot really trusted McWatt , happiest still got big boot buzzing plane Yossarian ’ tent roaring low bathers beach fierce wind propellers slashed dark furrows water whipped sheets spray flapping back seconds afterward . Dobbs Hungry Joe question , Orr , tinkering valve stove Yossarian limped despondently back tent Dobbs turned . The stove Orr manufacturing inverted metal drum stood middle smooth cement floor constructed . He working sedulously knees . Yossarian tried paying attention limped wearily cot sat labored , drawn-out grunt . Prickles perspiration turning chilly forehead . Dobbs depressed . Doc Daneeka depressed . An ominous vision doom depressed looked Orr . He began ticking variety internal tremors . Nerves twitched , vein one wrist began palpitating . Orr studied Yossarian shoulder , moist lips drawn back around convex rows large buck teeth . Reaching sideways , dug bottle warm beer foot locker , handed Yossarian prying cap . Neither said word . Yossarian sipped bubbles top tilted head back . Orr watched cunningly noiseless grin . Yossarian eyed Orr guardedly . Orr snickered slight , mucid sibilance turned back work , squatting . Yossarian grew tense . “ Don ’ start , ” begged threatening voice , hands tightening around beer bottle . “ Don ’ start working stove. ” Orr cackled quietly . “ I ’ almost finished. ” “ No , ’ . You ’ begin. ” “ Here ’ valve . See ? It ’ almost together. ” “ And ’ take apart . I know ’ , bastard . I ’ seen three hundred times. ” Orr shivered glee . “ I want get leak gasoline line , ” explained . “ I ’ got ’ ooze. ” “ I ’ watch , ” Yossarian confessed tonelessly . “ If want work something big , ’ okay . But valve filled tiny parts , I ’ got patience right watch working hard things goddam small unimportant. ” “ Just ’ small ’ mean ’ unimportant. ” “ I ’ care. ” “ Once ? ” “ When I ’ around . You ’ happy imbecile ’ know means feel way I . Things happen work small things I ’ even begin explain . I find I ’ stand . I start hate , I ’ soon thinking seriously busting bottle head stabbing neck hunting knife . Do understand ? ” Orr nodded intelligently . “ I ’ take valve apart , ” said , began taking apart , working slow , tireless , interminable precision , rustic , ungainly face bent close floor , picking painstakingly minute mechanism fingers limitless , plodding concentration seemed scarcely thinking . Yossarian cursed silently made mind ignore . “ What hell ’ hurry stove , anyway ? ” barked moment later spite . “ It ’ still hot . We ’ probably going swimming later . What worried cold for. ” “ The days getting shorter , ” Orr observed philosophically . “ I ’ like get finished ’ still time . You ’ best stove squadron I ’ . It burn night feed control I ’ fixing , metal plates radiate heat tent . If leave helmet full water thing go sleep , ’ warm water wash ready wake . Won ’ nice ? If want cook eggs soup , ’ set pot turn fire up. ” “ What mean , ? ” Yossarian wanted know . “ Where going ? ” Orr ’ stunted torso shook suddenly muffled spasm amusement . “ I ’ know , ” exclaimed , weird , wavering giggle gushed suddenly chattering buck teeth like exploding jet emotion . He still laughing continued , voice clogged saliva . “ If keep shooting way , I ’ know I ’ going be. ” Yossarian moved . “ Why ’ try stop flying , Orr ? You ’ got excuse. ” “ I ’ got eighteen missions. ” “ But ’ shot almost every one . You ’ either ditching crash-landing every time go up. ” “ Oh , I ’ mind flying missions . I guess ’ lots fun . You ought try flying ’ flying lead . Just laughs . Tee-hee. ” Orr gazed Yossarian corners eyes look pointed mirth . Yossarian avoided stare . “ They ’ got flying lead again. ” “ When ’ flying lead . If brains , know ’ ? You ’ go right Piltchard Wren tell want fly me. ” “ And get shot every time go ? What ’ fun ? ” “ That ’ ought , ” Orr insisted . “ I guess I ’ best pilot around comes ditching making crash landings . It would good practice you. ” “ Good practice ? ” “ Good practice case ever ditch make crash landing . Tee-hee-hee. ” “ Have got another bottle beer ? ” Yossarian asked morosely . “ Do want bust head ? ” This time Yossarian laugh . “ Like whore apartment Rome ? ” Orr sniggered lewdly , bulging crab apple cheeks blowing outward pleasure . “ Do really want know hitting head shoe ? ” teased . “ I know , ” Yossarian teased back . “ Nately ’ whore told me. ” Orr grinned like gargoyle . “ No ’ t. ” Yossarian felt sorry Orr . Orr small ugly . Who would protect lived ? Who would protect warm-hearted , simple-minded gnome like Orr rowdies cliques expert athletes like Appleby flies eyes would walk right swaggering conceit self-assurance every chance got ? Yossarian worried frequently Orr . Who would shield animosity deceit , people ambition embittered snobbery big shot ’ wife , squalid , corrupting indignities profit motive friendly neighborhood butcher inferior meat ? Orr happy unsuspecting simpleton thick mass wavy polychromatic hair parted center . He would mere child ’ play . They would take money , screw wife show kindness children . Yossarian felt flood compassion sweep . Orr eccentric midget , freakish , likable dwarf smutty mind thousand valuable skills would keep low income group life . He could use soldering iron hammer two boards together wood split nails bend . He could drill holes . He built good deal tent Yossarian away hospital . He filed chiseled perfect channel cement slender gasoline line flush floor ran stove tank built outside elevated platform . He constructed andirons fireplace excess bomb parts filled stout silver logs , framed stained wood photographs girls big breasts torn cheesecake magazines hung mantelpiece . Orr could open paint . He could mix paint , thin paint , remove paint . He could chop wood measure things ruler . He knew build fires . He could dig holes , real gift bringing water cans canteens tanks near mess hall . He could engross inconsequential task hours without growing restless bored , oblivious fatigue stump tree , almost taciturn . He uncanny knowledge wildlife afraid dogs cats beetles moths , foods like scrod tripe . Yossarian sighed drearily began brooding rumored mission Bologna . The valve Orr dismantling size thumb contained thirty-seven separate parts , excluding casing , many minute Orr required pinch tightly tips fingernails placed carefully floor orderly , catalogued rows , never quickening movements slowing , never tiring , never pausing relentless , methodical , monotonous procedure unless leer Yossarian maniacal mischief . Yossarian tried watch . He counted parts thought would go clear mind . He turned away , shutting eyes , even worse , sounds , tiny maddening , indefatigable , distinct clicks rustles hands weightless parts . Orr breathing rhythmically noise stertorous repulsive . Yossarian clenched fists looked long bone-handled hunting knife hanging holster cot dead man tent . As soon thought stabbing Orr , tension eased . The idea murdering Orr ridiculous began consider seriously queer whimsy fascination . He searched nape Orr ’ neck probable site medulla oblongata . Just daintiest stick would kill solve many serious , agonizing problems . “ Does hurt ? ” Orr asked precisely moment , though protective instinct . Yossarian eyed closely . “ Does hurt ? ” “ Your leg , ” said Orr strange , mysterious laugh . “ You still limp little. ” “ It ’ habit , I guess , ” said Yossarian , breathing relief . “ I ’ probably get soon. ” Orr rolled sideways floor came one knee , facing toward Yossarian . “ Do remember , ” drawled reflectively , air labored recollection , “ girl hitting head day Rome ? ” He chuckled Yossarian ’ involuntary exclamation tricked annoyance . “ I ’ make deal girl . I ’ tell girl hitting head shoe day answer one question. ” “ What ’ question ? ” “ Did ever screw Nately ’ girl ? ” Yossarian laughed surprise . “ Me ? No . Now tell girl hit shoe. ” “ That ’ question , ” Orr informed victorious delight . “ That conversation . She acts like screwed her. ” “ Well , I ’ . How act ? ” “ She acts like ’ like you. ” “ She ’ like anyone. ” “ She likes Captain Black , ” Orr reminded . “ That ’ treats like dirt . Anyone get girl way. ” “ She wears slave bracelet leg name it. ” “ He makes wear needle Nately. ” “ She even gives money gets Nately. ” “ Listen , want ? ” “ Did ever screw girl ? ” “ Your girl ? Who hell girl ? ” “ The one hit head shoe. ” “ I ’ couple times , ” Yossarian admitted . “ Since girl ? What getting ? ” “ She ’ like , either. ” “ What hell I care likes ? She likes much likes you. ” “ Did ever hit head shoe ? ” “ Orr , I ’ tired . Why ’ leave alone ? ” “ Tee-hee-hee . How skinny countess Rome skinny daughter-in-law ? ” Orr persisted impishly increasing zest . “ Did ever screw ? ” “ Oh , I wish I could , ” sighed Yossarian honestly , imagining , mere question , prurient , used , decaying feel petting hands teeny , pulpy buttocks breasts . “ They ’ like either , ” commented Orr . “ They like Aarfy , like Nately , ’ like . Women ’ seem like . I think think ’ bad influence. ” “ Women crazy , ” Yossarian answered , waited grimly knew coming next . “ How girl ? ” Orr asked pretense pensive curiosity . “ The fat one ? The bald one ? You know , fat bald one Sicily turban kept sweating us night long ? Is crazy ? ” “ Didn ’ like either ? ” “ How could girl hair ? ” “ How I supposed know hair ? ” “ I knew , ” Orr bragged . “ I knew time. ” “ You knew bald ? ” Yossarian exclaimed wonder . “ No , I knew valve ’ work I left part , ” Orr answered , glowing cranberry-red elation duped Yossarian . “ Will please hand small composition gasket rolled ? It ’ right near foot. ” “ No ’ t. ” “ Right , ” said Orr , took hold something invisible tips fingernails held Yossarian see . “ Now I ’ start again. ” “ I ’ kill . I ’ murder right spot. ” “ Why ’ ever fly ? ” Orr asked suddenly , looked straight Yossarian ’ face first time . “ There , ’ question I want answer . Why ’ ever fly ? ” Yossarian turned away intense shame embarrassment . “ I told . They ’ got flying lead bombardier time. ” “ That ’ , ” Orr said , shaking head . “ You went Piltchard Wren first Avignon mission told ’ ever want fly . That ’ , ’ ? ” Yossarian felt skin turn hot . “ No I ’ , ” lied . “ Yes , ” Orr insisted equably . “ You asked assign plane piloted , Dobbs Huple ’ confidence us controls . And Piltchard Wren said ’ make exception ’ fair men fly us. ” “ So ? ” said Yossarian . “ It ’ make difference , ? ” “ But ’ never made fly me. ” Orr , working knees , addressing Yossarian without bitterness reproach , injured humility , infinitely painful observe , although still grinning snickering , though situation comic . “ You really ought fly , know . I ’ pretty good pilot , I ’ take care . I may get knocked lot , ’ fault , nobody ’ ever hurt plane . Yes , sir-if brains , know ’ ? You ’ go right Piltchard Wren tell want fly missions me. ” Yossarian leaned forward peered closely Orr ’ inscrutable mask contradictory emotions . “ Are trying tell something ? ” “ Tee-hee-hee-hee , ” Orr responded . “ I ’ trying tell big girl shoe hitting head day . But ’ let me. ” “ Tell me. ” “ Will fly ? ” Yossarian laughed shook head . “ You ’ get knocked water again. ” Orr get knocked water rumored mission Bologna flown , landed single-engine plane smashing jar choppy , windswept waves tossing falling warlike black thunderclouds mobilizing overhead . He late getting plane ended alone raft began drifting away men raft sight time Air-Sea Rescue launch came plowing wind splattering raindrops take aboard . Night already falling time returned squadron . There word Orr . “ Don ’ worry , ” reassured Kid Sampson , still wrapped heavy blankets raincoat swaddled boat rescuers . “ He ’ probably picked already ’ drown storm . It ’ last long . I bet ’ show minute. ” Yossarian walked back tent wait Orr show minute lit fire make things warm . The stove worked perfectly , strong , robust blaze could raised lowered turning tap Orr finally finished repairing . A light rain falling , drumming softly tent , trees , ground . Yossarian cooked hot soup ready Orr ate time passed . He hard-boiled eggs Orr ate . Then ate whole tin Cheddar cheese package K rations . Each time caught worrying made remember Orr could everything broke silent laughter picture Orr raft Sergeant Knight described , bent forward busy , preoccupied smile map compass lap , stuffing one soaking-wet chocolate bar another grinning , tittering mouth paddled away dutifully lightning , thunder rain bright-blue useless toy oar , fishing line dried bait trailing behind . Yossarian really doubt Orr ’ ability survive . If fish could caught silly fishing line , Orr would catch , codfish , Orr would catch codfish , even though codfish ever caught waters . Yossarian put another soup cook ate hot . Every time car door slammed , broke hopeful smile turned expectantly toward entrance , listening footsteps . He knew moment Orr would come walking tent big , glistening , rain-soaked eyes , cheeks buck teeth , looking ludicrously like jolly New England oysterman yellow oilskin rain hat slicker numerous sizes large holding proudly Yossarian ’ amusement great dead codfish caught . But ’ . 29 PECKEM There word Orr next day , Sergeant Whitcomb , commendable dispatch considerable hope , dropped reminder tickler file send form letter Colonel Cathcart ’ signature Orr ’ next kin nine days elapsed .

He two full colonels ; General Dreedle five , four combat commanders . With almost intriguing , General Peckem executed maneuver would eventually double strength . And General Dreedle getting drunk often . The future looked wonderful , General Peckem contemplated bright new colonel enchantedly effulgent smile . In matters consequence , General P. P. Peckem , always remarked criticize work close associate publicly , realist . He handsome , pink-skinned man fifty-three . His manner always casual relaxed , uniforms custom-made . He silver-gray hair , slightly myopic eyes thin , overhanging , sensual lips . He perceptive , graceful , sophisticated man sensitive everyone ’ weaknesses found everyone absurd . General Peckem laid great , fastidious stress small matters taste style . He always augmenting things . Approaching events never coming , always upcoming . It true wrote memorandums praising recommending authority enhanced include combat operations ; wrote memoranda . And prose memoranda officers always turgid , stilted , ambiguous . The errors others inevitably deplorable . Regulations stringent , data never obtained reliable source , always obtained . General Peckem frequently constrained . Things often incumbent upon , frequently acted greatest reluctance . It never escaped memory neither black white color , never used verbal meant oral . He could quote glibly Plato , Nietzsche , Montaigne , Theodore Roosevelt , Marquis de Sade Warren G. Harding . A virgin audience like Colonel Scheisskopf grist General Peckem ’ mill , stimulating opportunity throw open whole dazzling erudite treasure house puns , wisecracks , slanders , homilies , anecdotes , proverbs , epigrams , apophthegms , bon mots pungent sayings . He beamed urbanely began orienting Colonel Scheisskopf new surroundings . “ My fault , ” observed practiced good humor , watching effect words , “ I faults. ” Colonel Scheisskopf ’ laugh , General Peckem stunned . A heavy doubt crushed enthusiasm . He opened one trusted paradoxes , positively alarmed slightest flicker acknowledgment moved across impervious face , began remind suddenly , hue texture , unused soap eraser . Perhaps Colonel Scheisskopf tired , General Peckem granted charitably ; come long way , everything unfamiliar . General Peckem ’ attitude toward personnel command , officers enlisted men , marked easy spirit tolerance permissiveness . He mentioned often people worked met halfway , would meet halfway , result , always added astute chuckle , never meeting minds . General Peckem thought aesthetic intellectual . When people disagreed , urged objective . And indeed objective Peckem gazed Colonel Scheisskopf encouragingly resumed indoctrination attitude magnanimous forgiveness . “ You ’ come us time , Scheisskopf . The summer offensive petered , thanks incompetent leadership supply troops , I crying need tough , experienced , competent officer like help produce memoranda upon rely heavily let people know good much work ’ turning . I hope prolific writer. ” “ I ’ know anything writing , ” Colonel Scheisskopf retorted sullenly . “ Well , ’ let trouble , ” General Peckem continued careless flick wrist . “ Just pass work I assign along somebody else trust luck . We call delegation responsibility . Somewhere near lowest level co-ordinated organization I run people get work done reaches , everything manages run along smoothly without much effort part . I suppose ’ I good executive . Nothing large department really important , ’ never rush . On hand , important let people know great deal . Let know find shorthanded . I ’ already put requisition two majors , four captains sixteen lieutenants give hand . While none work important , important great deal . Don ’ agree ? ” “ What parades ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf broke . “ What parades ? ” inquired General Peckem feeling polish ’ getting across . “ Won ’ I able conduct parades every Sunday afternoon ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf demanded petulantly . “ No . Of course . What ever gave idea ? ” “ But said I could. ” “ Who said could ? ” “ The officers sent overseas . They told I ’ able march men around parades I wanted to. ” “ They lied you. ” “ That ’ fair , sir. ” “ I ’ sorry , Scheisskopf . I ’ willing everything I make happy , parades question . We ’ enough men organization make much parade , combat units would rise open rebellion tried make march . I ’ afraid ’ hold back awhile get control . Then want men. ” “ What wife ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf demanded disgruntled suspicion . “ I ’ still able send , ’ I ? ” “ Your wife ? Why world want ? ” “ A husband wife together. ” “ That ’ question also. ” “ But said I could send ! ” “ They lied again. ” “ They right lie ! ” Colonel Scheisskopf protested , eyes wetting indignation . “ Of course right , ” General Peckem snapped cold calculated severity , resolving right test mettle new colonel fire . “ Don ’ ass , Scheisskopf . People right anything ’ forbidden law , ’ law lying . Now , ’ ever waste time sentimental platitudes . Do hear ? ” “ Yes , sir , ” murmured Colonel Scheisskopf Colonel Scheisskopf wilted pathetically , General Peckem blessed fates sent weakling subordinate . A man spunk would unthinkable . Having , General Peckem relented . He enjoy humiliating men . “ If wife Wac , I could probably transferred . But ’ I do. ” “ She friend ’ Wac , ” Colonel Scheisskopf offered hopefully . “ I ’ afraid ’ good enough . Have Mrs. Scheisskopf join Wacs wants , I ’ bring . But meantime , dear Colonel , let ’ get back little war , may . Here , briefly , military situation confronts us. ” General Peckem rose moved toward rotary rack enormous colored maps . Colonel Scheisskopf blanched . “ We ’ going combat , ? ” blurted horror . “ Oh , , course , ” General Peckem assured indulgently , companionable laugh . “ Please give credit , ’ ? That ’ ’ still Rome . Certainly , I ’ like Florence , , I could keep closer touch ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen . But Florence still bit near actual fighting suit me. ” General Peckem lifted wooden pointer swept rubber tip cheerfully across Italy one coast . “ These , Scheisskopf , Germans . They ’ dug mountains solidly Gothic Line ’ pushed till late next spring , although ’ going stop clods charge trying . That gives us Special Services almost nine months achieve objective . And objective capture every bomber group U.S. Air Force . After , ” said General Peckem low , well-modulated chuckle , “ dropping bombs enemy ’ special service , I wonder world . Don ’ agree ? ” Colonel Scheisskopf gave indication agree , General Peckem already entranced loquacity notice . “ Our position right excellent . Reinforcements like keep arriving , enough time plan entire strategy carefully . Our immediate goal , ” said , “ right here. ” And General Peckem swung pointer south island Pianosa tapped significantly upon large word lettered black grease pencil . The word DREEDLE . Colonel Scheisskopf , squinting , moved close map , first time since entered room light comprehension shed dim glow stolid face . “ I think I understand , ” exclaimed . “ Yes , I know I understand . Our first job capture Dreedle away enemy . Right ? ” General Peckem laughed benignly . “ No , Scheisskopf . Dreedle ’ side , Dreedle enemy . General Dreedle commands four bomb groups simply must capture order continue offensive . Conquering General Dreedle give us aircraft vital bases need carry operations areas . And battle , way , won. ” General Peckem drifted toward window , laughing quietly , settled back sill arms folded , greatly satisfied wit knowledgeable , blase impudence . The skilled choice words exercising exquisitely titillating . General Peckem liked listening talk , like listening talk . “ General Dreedle simply ’ know cope , ” gloated . “ I keep invading jurisdiction comments criticisms really none business , ’ know . When accuses seeking undermine , I merely answer purpose calling attention errors strengthen war effort eliminating inefficiency . Then I ask innocently ’ opposed improving war effort . Oh , grumbles bristles bellows , ’ really quite helpless . He ’ simply style . He ’ turning quite souse , know . The poor blockhead ’ even general . He tone , tone . Thank God ’ going last. ” General Peckem chuckled jaunty relish sailed smoothly along toward favorite learned allusion . “ I sometimes think Fortinbras-ha , ha-in play Hamlet William Shakespeare , keeps circling circling around action everything else falls apart , strolls end pick pieces . Shakespeare is- “ “ I ’ know anything plays , ” Colonel Scheisskopf broke bluntly . General Peckem looked amazement . Never reference Shakespeare ’ hallowed Hamlet ignored trampled upon rude indifference . He began wonder genuine concern sort shithead Pentagon foisted . “ What know ? ” asked acidly . “ Parades , ” answered Colonel Scheisskopf eagerly . “ Will I able send memos parades ? ” “ As long ’ schedule any. ” General Peckem returned chair still wearing frown . “ And long ’ interfere main assignment recommending authority Special Services expanded include combat activities. ” “ Can I schedule parades call ? ” General Peckem brightened instantly . “ Why , ’ wonderful idea ! But send weekly announcements postponing parades . Don ’ even bother schedule . That would infinitely disconcerting. ” General Peckem blossoming spryly cordiality . “ Yes , Scheisskopf , ” said , “ I think ’ really hit something . After , combat commander could possibly quarrel us notifying men ’ parade coming Sunday ? We ’ merely stating widely known fact . But implication beautiful . Yes , positively beautiful . We ’ implying could schedule parade chose . I ’ going like , Scheisskopf . Stop introduce Colonel Cargill tell ’ . I know two like other. ” Colonel Cargill came storming General Peckem ’ office minute later furor timid resentment . “ I ’ longer Scheisskopf , ” complained . “ Why ’ I one call parades ? ” “ Because Scheisskopf experience parades , ’ . You call U.S.O . shows want . In fact ’ ? Just think places ’ getting U.S.O . show given day . Think places big-name entertainer ’ visiting . Yes , Cargill , I think ’ hit something . I think ’ thrown open whole new area operation us . Tell Colonel Scheisskopf I want work along supervision . And send see ’ giving instructions. ” “ Colonel Cargill says told want work along supervision U.S.O . project , ” Colonel Scheisskopf complained . “ I told thing , ” answered General Peckem . “ Confidentially , Scheisskopf , I ’ happy Colonel Cargill . He ’ bossy ’ slow . I ’ like keep close eye ’ see ’ get little work him. ” “ He keeps butting , ” Colonel Cargill protested . “ He ’ let get work done. ” “ There ’ something funny Scheisskopf , ” General Peckem agreed reflectively . “ Keep close eye see ’ find ’ to. ” “ Now ’ butting business ! ” Colonel Scheisskopf cried . “ Don ’ let worry , Scheisskopf , ” said General Peckem , congratulating adeptly fit Colonel Scheisskopf standard method operation . Already two colonels barely speaking terms . “ Colonel Cargill envies splendid job ’ parades . He ’ afraid I ’ going put charge bomb patterns. ” Colonel Scheisskopf ears . “ What bomb patterns ? ” “ Bomb patterns ? ” General Peckem repeated , twinkling self-satisfied good humor . “ A bomb pattern term I dreamed several weeks ago . It means nothing , ’ surprised rapidly ’ caught . Why , I ’ got sorts people convinced I think ’ important bombs explode close together make neat aerial photograph . There ’ one colonel Pianosa ’ hardly concerned whether hits target . Let ’ fly fun today . It make Colonel Cargill jealous , I learned Wintergreen morning General Dreedle Sardinia . It drives General Dreedle insane find I ’ inspecting one installations ’ inspecting another . We may even get time briefing . They ’ bombing tiny undefended village , reducing whole community rubble . I Wintergreen-Wintergreen ’ ex-sergeant , way-that mission entirely unnecessary . Its purpose delay German reinforcements time ’ even planning offensive . But ’ way things go elevate mediocre people positions authority. ” He gestured languidly toward gigantic map Italy . “ Why , tiny mountain village insignificant ’ even there. ” They arrived Colonel Cathcart ’ group late attend preliminary briefing hear Major Danby insist , “ But , I tell . It ’ , ’ there. ” “ It ’ ? ” Dunbar demanded defiantly , pretending see . “ It ’ right map road makes slight turn . Can ’ see slight turn map ? ” “ No , I ’ see it. ” “ I see , ” volunteered Havermeyer , marked spot Dunbar ’ map . “ And ’ good picture village right photographs . I understand whole thing . The purpose mission knock whole village sliding side mountain create roadblock Germans clear . Is right ? ” “ That ’ right , ” said Major Danby , mopping perspiring forehead handkerchief . “ I ’ glad somebody beginning understand . These two armored divisions coming Austria Italy along road . The village built steep incline rubble houses buildings destroy certainly tumble right pile upon road. ” “ What hell difference make ? ” Dunbar wanted know , Yossarian watched excitedly mixture awe adulation . “ It take couple days clear it. ” Major Danby trying avoid argument . “ Well , apparently makes difference Headquarters , ” answered conciliatory tone . “ I suppose ’ ordered mission. ” “ Have people village warned ? ” asked McWatt . Major Danby dismayed McWatt registering opposition . “ No , I ’ think so. ” “ Haven ’ dropped leaflets telling time ’ flying hit ? ” asked Yossarian . “ Can ’ even tip ’ get way ? ” “ No , I ’ think so. ” Major Danby swearing still shifting eyes uneasily . “ The Germans might find choose another road . I ’ sure . I ’ making assumptions. ” “ They ’ even take shelter , ” Dunbar argued bitterly . “ They ’ pour streets wave see planes coming , children dogs old people . Jesus Christ ! Why ’ leave alone ? ” “ Why ’ create roadblock somewhere else ? ” asked McWatt . “ Why must ? ” “ I ’ know , ” Major Danby answered unhappily . “ I ’ know . Look , fellows , ’ got confidence people us issue orders . They know ’ doing. ” “ The hell , ” said Dunbar . “ What ’ trouble ? ” inquired Colonel Korn , moving leisurely across briefing room hands pockets tan shirt baggy . “ Oh , trouble , Colonel , ” said Major Danby , trying nervously cover . “ We ’ discussing mission. ” “ They ’ want bomb village , ” Havermeyer snickered , giving Major Danby away . “ You prick ! ” Yossarian said Havermeyer . “ You leave Havermeyer alone , ” Colonel Korn ordered Yossarian curtly . He recognized Yossarian drunk accosted roughly officers ’ club one night first mission Bologna , swung displeasure prudently Dunbar . “ Why ’ want bomb village ? ” “ It ’ cruel , ’ why. ” “ Cruel ? ” asked Colonel Korn cold good humor , frightened momentarily uninhibited vehemence Dunbar ’ hostility . “ Would less cruel let two German divisions fight troops ? American lives stake , , know . Would rather see American blood spilled ? ” “ American blood spilled . But people living peace . Why ’ leave hell alone ? ” “ Yes , ’ easy talk , ” Colonel Korn jeered . “ You ’ safe Pianosa . It ’ make difference German reinforcements arrive , ? ” Dunbar turned crimson embarrassment replied voice suddenly defensive . “ Why ’ create roadblock somewhere else ? Couldn ’ bomb slope mountain road ? ” “ Would rather go back Bologna ? ” The question , asked quietly , rang like shot created silence room awkward menacing . Yossarian prayed intensely , shame , Dunbar would keep mouth shut . Dunbar dropped gaze , Colonel Korn knew . “ No , I thought , ” continued undisguised scorn . “ You know , Colonel Cathcart I go lot trouble get milk run like . If ’ sooner fly missions Bologna , Spezia Ferrara , get targets trouble all. ” His eyes gleamed dangerously behind rimless glasses , muddy jowls square hard . “ Just let know. ” “ I would , ” responded Havermeyer eagerly another boastful snicker . “ I like fly Bologna straight level head bombsight listen flak pumping away around . I get big kick way men come charging mission call dirty names . Even enlisted men get sore enough curse want take socks me. ” Colonel Korn chucked Havermeyer chin jovially , ignoring , addressed Dunbar Yossarian dry monotone . “ You ’ got sacred word . Nobody distressed lousy wops hills Colonel Cathcart . Mais c ” est la guerre . Try remember ’ start war Italy . That ’ aggressors Italy . And ’ possibly inflict much cruelty Italians , Germans , Russians Chinese ’ already inflicting themselves. ” Colonel Korn gave Major Danby ’ shoulder friendly squeeze without changing unfriendly expression . “ Carry briefing , Danby . And make sure understand importance tight bomb pattern. ” “ Oh , , Colonel , ” Major Danby blurted , blinking upward . “ Not target . I ’ told space bombs sixty feet apart ’ roadblock full length village instead one spot . It much effective roadblock loose bomb pattern. ” “ We ’ care roadblock , ” Colonel Korn informed . “ Colonel Cathcart wants come mission good clean aerial photograph ’ ashamed send channels . Don ’ forget General Peckem full briefing , know feels bomb patterns . Incidentally , Major , ’ better hurry details clear gets . General Peckem ’ stand you. ” “ Oh , , Colonel , ” Major Danby corrected obligingly . “ It ’ General Dreedle ’ stand me. ” “ General Peckem ’ stand either . In fact , one stand . Finish ’ , Danby , disappear . I ’ conduct briefing. ” “ Where ’ Major Danby ? ” Colonel Cathcart inquired , driven full briefing General Peckem Colonel Scheisskopf . “ He asked permission leave soon saw driving , ” answered Colonel Korn . “ He ’ afraid General Peckem ’ like . I going conduct briefing anyway . I much better job. ” “ Splendid ! ” said Colonel Cathcart . “ No ! ” Colonel Cathcart countermanded instant later remembered good job Colonel Korn done General Dreedle first Avignon briefing . “ I ’ myself. ” Colonel Cathcart braced knowledge one General Peckem ’ favorites took charge meeting , snapping words crisply attentive audience subordinate officers bluff dispassionate toughness picked General Dreedle . He knew cut fine figure platform open shirt collar , cigarette holder , close-cropped , gray-tipped curly black hair . He breezed along beautifully , even emulating certain characteristic mispronunciations General Dreedle ’ , least bit intimidated General Peckem ’ new colonel suddenly recalled General Peckem detested General Dreedle . Then voice cracked , confidence left . He stumbled ahead instinct burning humiliation . He suddenly terror Colonel Scheisskopf . Another colonel area meant another rival , another enemy , another person hated . And one tough ! A horrifying thought occurred Colonel Cathcart : Suppose Colonel Scheisskopf already bribed men room begin moaning , done first Avignon mission . How could silence ? What terrible black eye would ! Colonel Cathcart seized fright almost beckoned Colonel Korn . Somehow held together synchronized watches . When done , knew , could end time . He come crisis . He wanted laugh Colonel Scheisskopf ’ face triumph spite . He proved brilliantly pressure , concluded briefing inspiring peroration every instinct told masterful exhibition eloquent tact subtlety . “ Now , men , ” exhorted . “ We us today distinguished guest , General Peckem Special Services , man gives us softball bats , comic books U.S.O . shows . I want dedicate mission . Go bomb-for , country , God , great American , General P. P. Peckem . And let ’ see put bombs dime ! ” 30 DUNBAR Yossarian longer gave damn bombs fell , although go far Dunbar , dropped bombs hundreds yards past village would face court-martial could ever shown done deliberately . Without word even Yossarian , Dunbar washed hands mission . The fall hospital either shown light scrambled brains ; impossible say . Dunbar seldom laughed seemed wasting away . He snarled belligerently superior officers , even Major Danby , crude surly profane even front chaplain , afraid Dunbar seemed wasting away also . The chaplain ’ pilgrimage Wintergreen proved abortive ; another shrine empty . Wintergreen busy see chaplain . A brash assistant brought chaplain stolen Zippo cigarette lighter gift informed condescendingly Wintergreen deeply involved wartime activities concern matters trivial number missions men fly . The chaplain worried Dunbar brooded Yossarian Orr gone . To chaplain , lived spacious tent whose pointy top sealed gloomy solitude night like cap tomb , seemed incredible Yossarian really preferred living alone wanted roommates . As lead bombardier , Yossarian McWatt pilot , one consolation , although still utterly undefended . There way fight back . He could even see McWatt co-pilot post nose . All could ever see Aarfy , whose fustian , moon-faced ineptitude finally lost patience , minutes agonizing fury frustration sky hungered demoted wing plane loaded machine gun compartment instead precision bombsight really need , powerful , heavy fifty-caliber machine gun could seize vengefully hands turn loose savagely demons tyrannizing : smoky black puffs flak ; German antiaircraft gunners could even see could possibly harm machine gun even ever take time open fire , Havermeyer Appleby lead plane fearless straight level bomb run second mission Bologna flak two hundred twenty-four cannons knocked one Orr ’ engines last time sent ditching sea Genoa La Spezia brief thunderstorm broke . Actually , much could powerful machine gun except load test-fire rounds . It use bombsight . He could really cut loose attacking German fighters , German fighters , could even swing way around helpless faces pilots like Huple Dobbs order back carefully ground , ordered Kid Sampson back , exactly want Dobbs Huple hideous first mission Avignon moment realized fantastic pickle , moment found aloft wing plane Dobbs Huple flight headed Havermeyer Appleby . Dobbs Huple ? Huple Dobbs ? Who ? What preposterous madness float thin air two miles high inch two metal , sustained death meager skill intelligence two vapid strangers , beardless kid named Huple nervous nut like Dobbs , really go nuts right plane , running amuck target without leaving copilot ’ seat grabbing controls Huple plunge chilling dive tore Yossarian ’ headset loose brought right back inside dense flak almost escaped . The next thing knew , another stranger , radio-gunner named Snowden , dying back . It impossible positive Dobbs killed , Yossarian plugged headset back , Dobbs already intercom pleading someone go front help bombardier . And almost immediately Snowden broke , whimpering , “ Help . Please help . I ’ cold . I ’ cold. ” And Yossarian crawled slowly nose top bomb bay wriggled back rear section plane-passing first-aid kit way return for-to treat Snowden wrong wound , yawning , raw , melon-shaped hole big football outside thigh , unsevered , blood-soaked muscle fibers inside pulsating weirdly like blind things lives , oval , naked wound almost foot long made Yossarian moan shock sympathy instant spied nearly made vomit . And small , slight tail-gunner lying floor beside Snowden dead faint , face white handkerchief , Yossarian sprang forward revulsion help first . Yes , long run , much safer flying McWatt , even safe McWatt , loved flying much went buzzing boldly inches ground Yossarian nose way back training flight break new bombardier whole replacement crew Colonel Cathcart obtained Orr lost . The practice bomb range side Pianosa , , flying back , McWatt edged belly lazing , slow-cruising plane crest mountains middle , instead maintaining altitude , jolted engines open way , lurched one side , Yossarian ’ astonishment , began following falling land fast plane would go , wagging wings gaily skimming massive , grinding , hammering roar rocky rise dip rolling terrain like dizzy gull wild brown waves . Yossarian petrified . The new bombardier beside sat demurely bewitched grin kept whistling “ Whee ! ” Yossarian wanted reach crush idiotic face one hand flinched flung away boulders hillocks lashing branches trees loomed front rushed past underneath sinking , streaking blur . No one right take frightful risks life . “ Go , go , go ! ” shouted frantically McWatt , hating venomously , McWatt singing buoyantly intercom probably ’ hear . Yossarian , blazing rage almost sobbing revenge , hurled crawlway fought way dragging weight gravity inertia arrived main section pulled flight deck , stand trembling behind McWatt pilot ’ seat . He looked desperately gun , gray-black.45 automatic could cock ram right base McWatt ’ skull . There gun . There hunting knife either , weapon could bludgeon stab , Yossarian grasped jerked collar McWatt ’ coveralls tightening fists shouted go , go . The land still swimming underneath flashing overhead sides . McWatt looked back Yossarian laughed joyfully though Yossarian sharing fun . Yossarian slid hands around McWatt ’ bare throat squeezed . McWatt turned stiff : “ Go , ” Yossarian ordered unmistakably teeth low , menacing voice . “ Or I ’ kill you. ” Rigid caution , McWatt cut motors back climbed gradually . Yossarian ’ hands weakened McWatt ’ neck slid shoulders dangle inertly . He angry . He ashamed . When McWatt turned , sorry hands wished someplace could bury . They felt dead . McWatt gazed deeply . There friendliness stare . “ Boy , ” said coldly , “ sure must pretty bad shape . You ought go home. ” “ They ’ let me. ” Yossarian answered averted eyes , crept away . Yossarian stepped flight deck seated floor , hanging head guilt remorse . He covered sweat . McWatt set course directly back toward field . Yossarian wondered whether McWatt would go operations tent see Piltchard Wren request Yossarian never assigned plane , Yossarian gone surreptitiously speak Dobbs Huple Orr , unsuccessfully , Aarfy . He never seen McWatt look displeased , never seen lighthearted mood , wondered whether lost another friend . But McWatt winked reassuringly climbed plane joshed hospitably credulous new pilot bombardier jeep ride back squadron , although address word Yossarian four returned parachutes separated two walking side side toward row tents . Then McWatt ’ sparsely freckled tan Scotch-Irish face broke suddenly smile dug knuckles playfully Yossarian ’ ribs , though throwing punch . “ You louse , ” laughed . “ Were really going kill ? ” Yossarian grinned penitently shook head . “ No . I ’ think so. ” “ I ’ realize got bad . Boy ! Why ’ talk somebody ? ” “ I talk everybody . What hell ’ matter ? Don ’ ever hear ? ” “ I guess I never really believed you. ” “ Aren ’ ever afraid ? ” “ Maybe I ought be. ” “ Not even missions ? ” “ I guess I ’ brains enough. ” McWatt laughed sheepishly . “ There many ways get killed , ” Yossarian commented , “ find one more. ” McWatt smiled . “ Say , I bet must really scare I buzz tent , huh ? ” “ It scares death . I ’ told that. ” “ I thought noise complaining about. ” McWatt made resigned shrug . “ Oh , well , hell , ” sang . “ I guess I ’ give up. ” But McWatt incorrigible , , never buzzed Yossarian ’ tent , never missed opportunity buzz beach roar like fierce low-flying thunderbolt raft water secluded hollow sand Yossarian lay feeling Nurse Duckett playing hearts , poker pinochle Nately , Dunbar Hungry Joe . Yossarian met Nurse Duckett almost every afternoon free came beach side narrow swell shoulder-high dunes separating area officers enlisted men went swimming nude . Nately , Dunbar Hungry Joe would come , . McWatt would occasionally join , often Aarfy , always arrived pudgily full uniform never removed clothing shoes hat ; Aarfy never went swimming . The men wore swimming trunks deference Nurse Duckett , deference also Nurse Cramer , accompanied Nurse Duckett Yossarian beach every time sat haughtily ten yards away . No one Aarfy ever made reference naked men sun-bathing full view farther beach jumping diving enormous white-washed raft bobbed empty oil drums beyond silt sand . Nurse Cramer sat angry Yossarian disappointed Nurse Duckett . Nurse Sue Ann Duckett despised Aarfy , another one numerous fetching traits Nurse Duckett Yossarian enjoyed . He enjoyed Nurse Sue Ann Duckett ’ long white legs supple , callipygous ass ; often neglected remember quite slim fragile waist hurt unintentionally moments passion hugged roughly . He loved manner sleepy acquiescence lay beach dusk . He drew solace sedation nearness . He craving touch always , remain always physical communication . He liked encircle ankle loosely fingers played cards Nately , Dunbar Hungry Joe , lightly lovingly caress downy skin fair , smooth thigh backs nails , dreamily , sensuously , almost unconsciously , slide proprietary , respectful hand shell-like ridge spine beneath elastic strap top two-piece bathing suit always wore contain cover tiny , long-nippled breasts . He loved Nurse Duckett ’ serene , flattered response , sense attachment displayed proudly . Hungry Joe craving feel Nurse Duckett , , restrained Yossarian ’ forbidding glower . Nurse Duckett flirted Hungry Joe keep heat , round light-brown eyes glimmered mischief every time Yossarian rapped sharply elbow fist make stop . The men played cards towel , undershirt , blanket , Nurse Duckett mixed extra deck cards , sitting back resting sand dune . When shuffling extra deck cards , sat squinting tiny pocket mirror , brushing mascara curling reddish eyelashes birdbrained effort make longer permanently . Occasionally able stack cards spoil deck way discover well game , laughed glowed blissful gratification hurled cards disgustedly began punching sharply arms legs called filthy names warned stop fooling around . She would prattle nonsensically striving hardest think , pink flush elation crept cheeks gave sharp raps arms legs fists told shut . Nurse Duckett reveled attention ducked short chestnut bangs joy Yossarian others focused upon . It gave peculiar feeling warm expectant well-being know many naked boys men idling close side sand dunes . She stretch neck rise pretext see twenty forty undressed males lounging playing ball sunlight . Her body familiar unremarkable thing puzzled convulsive ecstasy men could take , intense amusing need merely touch , reach urgently press , squeeze , pinch , rub . She understand Yossarian ’ lust ; willing take word . Evenings Yossarian felt horny brought Nurse Duckett beach two blankets enjoyed making love clothes sometimes enjoyed making love vigorous bare amoral girls Rome . Frequently went beach night make love , lay shivering blankets ward brisk , damp chill . The ink-black nights turning cold , stars frosty fewer . The raft swayed ghostly trail moonlight seemed sailing away . A marked hint cold weather penetrated air . Other men starting build stoves came Yossarian ’ tent day marvel Orr ’ workmanship . It thrilled Nurse Duckett rapturously Yossarian could keep hands together , although would let slip inside bathing shorts day anyone near enough see , even witness Nurse Cramer , sat side sand dune reproving nose air pretended see anything . Nurse Cramer stopped speaking Nurse Duckett , best friend , liaison Yossarian , still went everywhere Nurse Duckett since Nurse Duckett best friend . She approve Yossarian friends . When stood went swimming Nurse Duckett , Nurse Cramer stood went swimming , , maintaining ten-yard distance , maintaining silence , snubbing even water . When laughed splashed , laughed splashed ; dived , dived ; swam sand bar rested , Nurse Cramer swam sand bar rested . When came , came , dried shoulders towel seated aloofly spot , back rigid ring reflected sunlight burnishing light-blond hair like halo . Nurse Cramer prepared begin talking Nurse Duckett repented apologized . Nurse Duckett preferred things way . For long time wanted give Nurse Cramer rap make shut . Nurse Duckett found Yossarian wonderful already trying change . She loved watch taking short naps face arm thrown across , staring bleakly endless tame , quiet waves breaking like pet puppy dogs shore , scampering lightly sand foot two trotting away . She calm silences . She knew bore , buffed painted fingernails studiously dozed brooded desultory warm afternoon breeze vibrated delicately surface beach . She loved look wide , long , sinewy back bronzed , unblemished skin . She loved bring flame instantly taking whole ear mouth suddenly running hand front way . She loved make burn suffer till dark , satisfy . Then kiss adoringly brought bliss . Yossarian never lonely Nurse Duckett , really know keep mouth shut capricious enough . He haunted tormented vast , boundless ocean . He wondered mournfully , Nurse Duckett buffed nails , people died water . There surely million already . Where ? What insects eaten flesh ? He imagined awful impotence breathing helplessly quarts quarts water . Yossarian followed small fishing boats military launches plying back forth far found unreal ; seem true full-sized men aboard , going somewhere every time . He looked toward stony Elba , eyes automatically searched overhead fluffy , white , turnip-shaped cloud Clevinger vanished . He peered vaporous Italian skyline thought Orr . Clevinger Orr . Where gone ? Yossarian stood jetty dawn watched tufted round log drifting toward tide turn unexpectedly bloated face drowned man ; first dead person ever seen . He thirsted life reached ravenously grasp hold Nurse Duckett ’ flesh . He studied every floating object fearfully gruesome sign Clevinger Orr , prepared morbid shock shock McWatt gave one day plane came blasting suddenly sight distant stillness hurtled mercilessly along shore line great growling , clattering roar bobbing raft blond , pale Kid Sampson , naked sides scrawny even far away , leaped clownishly touch exact moment arbitrary gust wind minor miscalculation McWatt ’ senses dropped speeding plane low enough propeller slice half away . Even people remembered vividly exactly happened next . There briefest , softest tsst ! filtering audibly shattering , overwhelming howl plane ’ engines , Kid Sampson ’ two pale , skinny legs , still joined strings somehow bloody truncated hips , standing stock-still raft seemed full minute two toppled backward water finally faint , echoing splash turned completely upside grotesque toes plaster-white soles Kid Sampson ’ feet remained view . On beach , hell broke loose . Nurse Cramer materialized thin air suddenly weeping hysterically Yossarian ’ chest Yossarian hugged shoulders soothed . His arm bolstered Nurse Duckett , trembling sobbing , , long , angular face dead white . Everyone beach screaming running , men sounded like women . They scampered things panic , stooping hurriedly looking askance gentle , knee-high wave bubbling though ugly , red , grisly organ like liver lung might come washing right . Those water struggling get , forgetting haste swim , wailing , walking , held back flight viscous , clinging sea though biting wind . Kid Sampson rained . Those spied drops limbs torsos drew back terror revulsion , though trying shrink away odious skins . Everybody ran sluggish stampede , shooting tortured , horrified glances back , filling deep , shadowy , rustling woods frail gasps cries . Yossarian drove stumbling , faltering women frantically , shoving prodding make hurry , raced back curse help Hungry Joe tripped blanket camera case carrying fell forward face mud stream . Back squadron everyone already knew . Men uniform screaming running , standing motionless one spot , rooted awe , like Sergeant Knight Doc Daneeka gravely craned heads upward watched guilty , banking , forlorn airplane McWatt circle circle slowly climb . “ Who ? ” Yossarian shouted anxiously Doc Daneeka ran , breathless limp , somber eyes burning misty , hectic anguish . “ Who ’ plane ? ” “ McWatt , ” said Sergeant Knight . “ He ’ got two new pilots training flight . Doc Daneeka ’ , too. ” “ I ’ right , ” contended Doc Daneeka , strange troubled voice , darting anxious look Sergeant Knight . “ Why ’ come ? ” Yossarian exclaimed despair . “ Why keep going ? ” “ He ’ probably afraid come , ” Sergeant Knight answered , without moving solemn gaze McWatt ’ solitary climbing airplane . “ He knows kind trouble ’ in. ” And McWatt kept climbing higher higher , nosing droning airplane upward evenly slow , oval spiral carried far water headed south far russet foothills circled landing field flying north . He soon five thousand feet . His engines soft whispers . A white parachute popped open suddenly surprising puff . A second parachute popped open minutes later coasted , like first , directly toward clearing landing strip . There motion ground . The plane continued south thirty seconds , following pattern , familiar predictable , McWatt lifted wing banked gracefully around turn . “ Two go , ” said Sergeant Knight . “ McWatt Doc Daneeka. ” “ I ’ right , Sergeant Knight , ” Doc Daneeka told plaintively . “ I ’ plane. ” “ Why ’ jump ? ” Sergeant Knight asked , pleading aloud . “ Why ’ jump ? ” “ It ’ make sense , ” grieved Doc Daneeka , biting lip . “ It ’ make sense. ” But Yossarian understood suddenly McWatt ’ jump , went running uncontrollably whole length squadron McWatt ’ plane , waving arms shouting imploringly come , McWatt , come ; one seemed hear , certainly McWatt , great , choking moan tore Yossarian ’ throat McWatt turned , dipped wings salute , decided oh , well , hell , flew mountain . Colonel Cathcart upset deaths Kid Sampson McWatt raised missions sixty-five . 31 MRS. DANEEKA When Colonel Cathcart learned Doc Daneeka killed McWatt ’ plane , increased number missions seventy . The first person squadron find Doc Daneeka dead Sergeant Towser , informed earlier man control tower Doc Daneeka ’ name passenger pilot ’ manifest McWatt filed taking .

Even dark , young soldiers pasty white faces throwing everywhere passing drunkenly ground . The air turned foul . Other men picked steam hours passed , aimless , riotous celebration continued . It raw , violent , guzzling saturnalia spilled obstreperously woods officers ’ club spread hills toward hospital antiaircraft-gun emplacements . There fist fights squadron one stabbing . Corporal Kolodny shot leg intelligence tent playing loaded gun gums toes painted purple speeding ambulance lay back blood spurting wound . Men cut fingers , bleeding heads , stomach cramps broken ankles came limping penitently medical tent gums toes painted purple Gus Wes given laxative throw bushes . The joyous celebration lasted long night , stillness fractured often wild , exultant shouts cries people merry sick . There recurring sound retching moaning , laughter , greetings , threats swearing , bottles shattering rock . There dirty songs distance . It worse New Year ’ Eve . Yossarian went bed early safety soon dreamed fleeing almost headlong endless wooden staircase , making loud , staccato clatter heels . Then woke little realized someone shooting machine gun . A tortured , terrified sob rose throat . His first thought Milo attacking squadron , rolled cot floor lay underneath trembling , praying ball , heart thumping like drop forge , body bathed cold sweat . There noise planes . A drunken , happy laugh sounded afar . “ Happy New Year , Happy New Year ! ” triumphant familiar voice shouted hilariously high short , sharp bursts machine gun fire , Yossarian understood men gone prank one sandbagged machine-gun emplacements Milo installed hills raid squadron staffed men . Yossarian blazed hatred wrath saw victim irresponsible joke destroyed sleep reduced whimpering hulk . He wanted kill , wanted murder . He angrier ever , angrier even slid hands around McWatt ’ neck strangle . The gun opened fire . Voices cried “ Happy New Year ! ” gloating laughter rolled hills darkness like witch ’ glee . In moccasins coveralls , Yossarian charged tent revenge his.45 , ramming clip cartridges grip slamming bolt gun back load . He snapped safety catch ready shoot . He heard Nately running restrain , calling name . The machine gun opened fire black rise motor pool , orange tracer bullets skimmed like low-gliding dashes tops shadowy tents , almost clipping peaks . Roars rough laughter rang short bursts . Yossarian felt resentment boil like acid inside ; endangering life , bastards ! With blind , ferocious rage determination , raced across squadron past motor pool , running fast could , already pounding hills along narrow , winding path Nately finally caught , still calling “ Yo-Yo ! Yo-Yo ! ” pleading concern imploring stop . He grasped Yossarian ’ shoulders tried hold back . Yossarian twisted free , turning . Nately reached , Yossarian drove fist squarely Nately ’ delicate young face hard could , cursing , drew arm back hit , Nately dropped sight groan lay curled ground head buried hands blood streaming fingers . Yossarian whirled plunged ahead path without looking back . Soon saw machine gun . Two figures leaped silhouette heard fled night taunting laughter could get . He late . Their footsteps receded , leaving circle sandbags empty silent crisp windless moonlight . He looked dejectedly . Jeering laughter came , distance . A twig snapped nearby . Yossarian dropped knees cold thrill elation aimed . He heard stealthy rustle leaves side sandbags fired two quick rounds . Someone fired back , recognized shot . “ Dunbar ? called . “ Yossarian ? ” The two men left hiding places walked forward meet clearing weary disappointment , guns . They shivering slightly frosty air wheezing labor uphill rush . “ The bastards , ” said Yossarian . “ They got away. ” “ They took ten years life , ” Dunbar exclaimed . “ I thought son bitch Milo bombing us . I ’ never scared . I wish I knew bastards . “ One Sergeant Knight. ” “ Let ’ go kill him. ” Dunbar ’ teeth chattering . “ He right scare us way. ” Yossarian longer wanted kill anyone . “ Let ’ help Nately first . I think I hurt bottom hill. ” But sign Nately along path , even though Yossarian located right spot blood stones . Nately tent either , catch next morning checked hospital patients learning checked broken nose night . Nately beamed frightened surprise padded ward slippers robes behind Nurse Cramer assigned beds . Nately ’ nose bulky cast , two black eyes . He kept blushing giddily shy embarrassment saying sorry Yossarian came apologize hitting . Yossarian felt terrible ; could hardly bear look Nately ’ battered countenance , even though sight comical tempted guffaw . Dunbar disgusted sentimentality , three relieved Hungry Joe came barging unexpectedly intricate black camera trumped-up symptoms appendicitis near enough Yossarian take pictures feeling Nurse Duckett .

Hungry Joe irate inconsolable until-of people-the chaplain led wearing maroon corduroy bathrobe , shining like skinny lighthouse radiant grin self-satisfaction tremendous concealed . The chaplain entered hospital pain heart doctors thought gas stomach advanced case Wisconsin shingles . “ What world Wisconsin shingles ? ” asked Yossarian . “ That ’ doctors wanted know ! ” blurted chaplain proudly , burst laughter . No one ever seen waggish , happy . “ There ’ thing Wisconsin shingles . Don ’ understand ? I lied . I made deal doctors . I promised I would let know Wisconsin shingles went away would promise anything cure . I never told lie . Isn ’ wonderful ? ” The chaplain sinned , good . Common sense told telling lies defecting duty sins . On hand , everyone knew sin evil , good could come evil . But feel good ; felt positively marvelous . Consequently , followed logically telling lies defecting duty could sins . The chaplain mastered , moment divine intuition , handy technique protective rationalization , exhilarated discovery . It miraculous . It almost trick , saw , turn vice virtue slander truth , impotence abstinence , arrogance humility , plunder philanthropy , thievery honor , blasphemy wisdom , brutality patriotism , sadism justice . Anybody could ; required brains . It merely required character . With effervescent agility chaplain ran whole gamut orthodox immoralities , Nately sat bed flushed elation , astounded mad gang companions found nucleus . He flattered apprehensive , certain severe official would soon appear throw whole lot like pack bums . No one bothered . In evening trooped exuberantly see lousy Hollywood extravaganza Technicolor , trooped exuberantly back lousy Hollywood extravaganza , soldier white , Dunbar screamed went pieces . “ He ’ back ! ” Dunbar screamed . “ He ’ back ! He ’ back ! ” Yossarian froze tracks , paralyzed much eerie shrillness Dunbar ’ voice familiar , white , morbid sight soldier white covered head toe plaster gauze . A strange , quavering , involuntary noise came bubbling Yossarian ’ throat . “ He ’ back ! ” Dunbar screamed . “ He ’ back ! ” patient delirious fever echoed automatic terror . All ward erupted bedlam . Mobs sick injured men began ranting incoherently running jumping aisle though building fire .

Look record , ” Colonel Cathcart uttered deprecatory laugh . “ I ’ bet ’ generally known , Milo , I flown four missions , ? ” “ No , sir , ” Milo replied . “ It ’ generally known ’ flown two missions . And one occurred Aarfy accidentally flew enemy territory navigating Naples black-market water cooler. ” Colonel Cathcart , flushing embarrassment , abandoned argument . “ All right , Milo .

It ’ complicated , I might get shot time. ” Colonel Cathcart brightened instantly thought began rubbing hands avaricious zest . “ You know , Milo , I think Colonel Korn I might willing take syndicate hands , ” suggested offhand manner , almost licking lips savory anticipation . “ Our experience black-market plum tomatoes come useful . Where begin ? ” Milo watched Colonel Cathcart steadily bland guileless expression . “ Thank , sir , ’ good . Begin salt-free diet General Peckem fat-free diet General Dreedle. ” “ Let get pencil .

You ’ like I am-indispensable ! ” He pushed pencil aside rose feet frantic exasperation . “ Milo , ’ fly sixty-four missions . You ’ even fly one mission . The whole system would fall apart anything happened you. ” Milo nodded serenely complacent gratification . “ Sir , forbidding fly combat missions ? ” “ Milo , I forbid fly combat missions , ” Colonel Cathcart declared tone stern inflexible authority . “ But ’ fair , sir , ” said Milo . “ What record ? The men getting fame medals publicity . Why I penalized I ’ good job mess officer ? ” “ No , Milo , ’ fair . But I ’ see anything it. ” “ Maybe get someone else fly missions me. ” “ But maybe get someone else fly missions , ” Colonel Cathcart suggested . “ How striking coal miners Pennsylvania West Virginia ? ” Milo shook head . “ It would take long train . But men squadron , sir ? After , I ’ . They ought willing something return. ” “ But men squadron , Milo ? ” Colonel Cathcart exclaimed . “ After , ’ . They ought willing something return. ” “ What ’ fair fair. ” “ What ’ fair fair. ” “ They could take turns , sir. ” “ They might even take turns flying missions , Milo. ” “ Who gets credit ? ” “ You get credit , Milo . And man wins medal flying one missions , get medal. ” “ Who dies gets killed ? ” “ Why , dies , course . After , Milo , ’ fair fair .

And time I ’ really going jump missions , right eighty , really knock General Dreedle ’ eye . And good way get lousy rat Yossarian back combat might get killed. ” “ Yossarian ? ” A tremor deep concern passed Milo ’ simple , homespun features , scratched corner reddish-brown mustache thoughtfully . “ Yeah , Yossarian . I hear ’ going around saying ’ finished missions war ’ . Well , maybe finished missions . But ’ finished missions , ? Ha ! Ha ! Has got surprise coming ! ” “ Sir , Yossarian friend mine , ” Milo objected . “ I ’ hate responsible anything would put back combat . I owe lot Yossarian . Isn ’ way could make exception ? ” “ Oh , , Milo. ” Colonel Cathcart clucked sententiously , shocked suggestion . “ We must never play favorites .

So ’ take chances rest men , ’ ? ” “ What ’ fair fair , Milo. ” “ Yes , sir , ’ fair fair , ” Milo agreed . “ Yossarian better men , right expect special privileges , ? ” “ No , Milo .

Chaplain Shipman seated tent , laboring paperwork reading spectacles , phone rang news mid-air collision given field . His insides turned dry clay . His hand trembling put phone . His hand began trembling . The disaster immense contemplate . Twelve men killed-how ghastly , , awful ! His feeling terror grew . He prayed instinctively Yossarian , Nately , Hungry Joe friends would listed among victims , berated repentantly , pray safety pray death young men even know . It late pray ; yet knew . His heart pounding noise seemed coming somewhere outside , knew would never sit dentist ’ chair , never glance surgical tool , never witness automobile accident hear voice shout night , without experiencing violent thumping chest dreading going die . He would never watch another fist fight without fearing going faint crack skull open pavement suffer fatal heart attack cerebral hemorrhage . He wondered would ever see wife three small children . He wondered ever see wife , Captain Black planted mind strong doubts fidelity character women . There many men , felt , could prove satisfying sexually . When thought death , always thought wife , thought wife always thought losing . In another minute chaplain felt strong enough rise walk glum reluctance tent next door Sergeant Whitcomb . They drove Sergeant Whitcomb ’ jeep . The chaplain made fists hands keep shaking lay lap . He ground teeth together tried hear Sergeant Whitcomb chirruped exultantly tragic event . Twelve men killed meant twelve form letters condolence could mailed one bunch next kin Colonel Cathcart ’ signature , giving Sergeant Whitcomb hope getting article Colonel Cathcart The Saturday Evening Post time Easter . At field heavy silence prevailed , overpowering motion like ruthless , insensate spell holding thrall beings might break . The chaplain awe . He never beheld great , appalling stillness . Almost two hundred tired , gaunt , downcast men stood holding parachute packs somber unstirring crowd outside briefing room , faces staring blankly different angles stunned dejection . They seemed unwilling go , unable move . The chaplain acutely conscious faint noise footsteps made approached . His eyes searched hurriedly , frantically , immobile maze limp figures . He spied Yossarian finally feeling immense joy , mouth gaped open slowly unbearable horror noted Yossarian ’ vivid , beaten , grimy look deep , drugged despair . He understood , recoiling pain realization shaking head protesting imploring grimace , Nately dead . The knowledge struck numbing shock . A sob broke . The blood drained legs , thought going drop . Nately dead . All hope mistaken washed away sound Nately ’ name emerging recurring clarity almost inaudible babble murmuring voices suddenly aware first time . Nately dead : boy killed . A whimpering sound rose chaplain ’ throat , jaw began quiver . His eyes filled tears , crying . He started toward Yossarian tiptoe mourn beside share wordless grief . At moment hand grabbed roughly around arm brusque voice demanded , “ Chaplain Shipman ? ” He turned surprise face stout , pugnacious colonel large head mustache smooth , florid skin . He never seen man . “ Yes . What ? ” The fingers grasping chaplain ’ arm hurting , tried vain squirm loose . “ Come along. ” The chaplain pulled back frightened confusion . “ Where ? Why ? Who , anyway ? ” “ You ’ better come along us , Father , ” lean , hawk-faced major chaplain ’ side intoned reverential sorrow . “ We ’ government . We want ask questions. ” “ What kind questions ? What ’ matter ? ” “ Aren ’ Chaplain Shipman ? ” demanded obese colonel . “ He ’ one , ” Sergeant Whitcomb answered . “ Go along , ” Captain Black called chaplain hostile contemptuous sneer . “ Go car know ’ good you. ” Hands drawing chaplain away irresistibly . He wanted shout help Yossarian , seemed far away hear . Some men nearby beginning look awakening curiosity . The chaplain bent face away burning shame allowed led rear staff car seated fat colonel large , pink face skinny , unctuous , despondent major . He automatically held wrist , wondering moment wanted handcuff . Another officer already front seat . A tall M.P . whistle white helmet got behind wheel . The chaplain dare raise eyes closed car lurched area speeding wheels whining bumpy blacktop road . “ Where taking ? ” asked voice soft timidity guilt , gaze still averted . The notion came holding blame mid-air crash death Nately . “ What I done ? ” “ Why ’ keep trap shut let us ask questions ? ” said colonel . “ Don ’ talk way , ” said major . “ It ’ necessary disrespectful. ” “ Then tell keep trap shut let us ask questions. ” “ Father , please keep trap shut let us ask questions , ” urged major sympathetically . “ It better you. ” “ It ’ necessary call Father , ” said chaplain . “ I ’ Catholic. ” “ Neither I , Father , ” said major . “ It ’ I ’ devout person , I like call men God Father. ” “ He ’ even believe atheists foxholes , ” colonel mocked , nudged chaplain ribs familiarly . “ Go , Chaplain , tell . Are atheists foxholes ? ” “ I ’ know , sir , ” chaplain replied . “ I ’ never foxhole. ” The officer front swung head around swiftly quarrelsome expression . “ You ’ never heaven either , ? But know ’ heaven , ’ ? ” “ Or ? ” said colonel . “ That ’ serious crime ’ committed , Father , ” said major . “ What crime ? ” “ We ’ know yet , ” said colonel . “ But ’ going find . And sure know ’ serious. ” The car swung road Group Headquarters squeal tires , slackening speed slightly , continued around past parking lot back building . The three officers chaplain got . In single file , ushered wobbly flight wooden stairs leading basement led damp , gloomy room low cement ceiling unfinished stone walls . There cobwebs corners . A huge centipede blew across floor shelter water pipe . They sat chaplain hard , straight-backed chair stood behind small , bare table . “ Please make comfortable , Chaplain , ” invited colonel cordially , switching blinding spotlight shooting squarely chaplain ’ face . He placed set brass knuckles box wooden matches table . “ We want relax. ” The chaplain ’ eyes bulged incredulously . His teeth chattered limbs felt utterly without strength . He powerless . They might whatever wished , realized ; brutal men might beat death right basement , one would intervene save , one , perhaps , devout sympathetic major sharp face , set water tap dripping loudly sink returned table lay length heavy rubber hose beside brass knuckles . “ Everything ’ going right , Chaplain , ” major said encouragingly . “ You ’ got nothing afraid ’ guilty . What afraid ? You ’ guilty , ? ” “ Sure ’ guilty , ” said colonel . “ Guilty hell. ” “ Guilty ? ” implored chaplain , feeling bewildered knowing men appeal mercy . The third officer wore insignia lurked silence side . “ What I ? ” “ That ’ ’ going find , ” answered colonel , shoved pad pencil across table chaplain . “ Write name us , ? In handwriting. ” “ My handwriting ? ” “ That ’ right . Anywhere page. ” When chaplain finished , colonel took pad back held alongside sheet paper removed folder . “ See ? ” said major , come side peering solemnly shoulder . “ They ’ , ? ” major admitted . “ I told it. ” “ Did ? ” asked chaplain . “ Chaplain , comes great shock , ” major accused tone heavy lamentation . “ What ? ” “ I ’ tell disappointed I you. ” “ For ? ” persisted chaplain fiantically . “ What I done ? ” “ For , ” replied major , , air disillusioned disgust , tossed table pad chaplain signed name . “ This ’ handwriting. ” The chaplain blinked rapidly amazement . “ But course ’ handwriting. ” “ No ’ , Chaplain .

A person ’ lie handwriting lie anything. ” “ But lied handwriting ? ” demanded chaplain , forgetting fear wave anger indignation welled inside suddenly . “ Are crazy something ? What talking ? ” “ We asked write name handwriting . And ’ it. ” “ But course I . In whose handwriting I write ? ” “ In somebody else ’ s. ” “ Whose ? ” “ That ’ ’ going find , ” threatened colonel . “ Talk , Chaplain. ” The chaplain looked one two men rising doubt hysteria . “ That handwriting mine , ” maintained passionately . “ Where else handwriting , ’ ? ” “ Right , ” answered colonel . And looking superior , tossed table photostatic copy piece V mail everything salutation “ Dear Mary ” blocked censoring officer written , “ I long tragically . R. O.

Do know wrote ? ” The chaplain took long moment reply ; recognized Yossarian ’ handwriting . “ No. ” “ You read , though , ’ ? ” colonel persevered sarcastically . “ The author signed name. ” “ That ’ name there. ” “ Then wrote . Q.E.D. ” “ But I ’ write . That ’ handwriting , either. ” “ Then signed name somebody else ’ handwriting , ” colonel retorted shrug . “ That ’ means. ” “ Oh , ridiculous ! ” chaplain shouted , suddenly losing patience . He jumped feet blazing fury , fists clenched . “ I ’ going stand longer ! Do hear ? Twelve men killed , I time silly questions . You ’ right keep , I ’ going stand it. ” Without saying word , colonel pushed chaplain ’ chest hard knocked back chair , chaplain suddenly weak much afraid . The major picked length rubber hose began tapping menacingly open palm . The colonel lifted box matches , took one held poised striking surface , watching glowering eyes chaplain ’ next sign defiance . The chaplain pale almost petrified move . The bright glare spotlight made turn away finally ; dripping water louder almost unbearably irritating . He wished would tell wanted would know confess . He waited tensely third officer , signal colonel , ambled wall seated table inches away chaplain . His face expressionless , eyes penetrating cold . “ Turn light , ” said shoulder low , calm voice . “ It ’ annoying. ” The chaplain gave small smile gratitude . “ Thank , sir . And drip , please. ” “ Leave drip , ” said officer . “ That ’ bother me. ” He tugged legs trousers bit , though preserve natty crease . “ Chaplain , ” asked casually , “ religious persuasion ? ” “ I ’ Anabaptist , sir. ” “ That ’ pretty suspicious religion , ’ ? ” “ Suspicious ? ” inquired chaplain kind innocent daze . “ Why , sir ? ” “ Well , I ’ know thing .

Now , Chaplain , say ’ Baptist ’ really tell us anything , ? You could anything anyone. ” He leaned forward slightly manner took shrewd significant air . “ You could even , ” added , “ Washington Irving , ’ ? ” “ Washington Irving ? ” chaplain repeated surprise . “ Come , Washington , ” corpulent colonel broke irascibly . “ Why ’ make clean breast ? We know stole plum tomato. ” After moment ’ shock , chaplain giggled nervous relief . “ Oh , ! ” exclaimed . “ Now I ’ beginning understand . I ’ steal plum tomato , sir . Colonel Cathcart gave . You even ask ’ believe me. ” A door opened end room Colonel Cathcart stepped basement though closet . “ Hello , Colonel . Colonel , claims gave plum tomato .

The smuggling national scandal , Marchese , truly national disgrace. ” “ Is fact ? ” Milo observed preoccupied smile started toward door though spell . “ Milo ! ” Yossarian yelled , bounded forward impulsively intercept . “ Milo , ’ got help me. ” “ Illegal tobacco , ” Milo explained look epileptic lust , struggling doggedly get . “ Let go . I ’ got smuggle illegal tobacco. ” “ Stay help find , ” pleaded Yossarian . “ You smuggle illegal tobacco tomorrow. ” But Milo deaf kept pushing forward , nonviolently irresistibly , sweating , eyes , though grip blind fixation , burning feverishly , twitching mouth slavering . He moaned calmly though remote , instinctive distress kept repeating , “ Illegal tobacco , illegal tobacco. ” Yossarian stepped way resignation finally saw hopeless try reason . Milo gone like shot . The commissioner police unbuttoned tunic looked Yossarian contempt . “ What want ? ” asked coldly . “ Do want arrest ? ” Yossarian walked office stairs dark , tomblike street , passing hall stout woman warts two chins , already way back . There sign Milo outside . There lights windows . The deserted sidewalk rose steeply continuously several blocks . He could see glare broad avenue top long cobblestone incline . The police station almost bottom ; yellow bulbs entrance sizzled dampness like wet torches . A frigid , fine rain falling . He began walking slowly , pushing uphill . Soon came quiet , cozy , inviting restaurant red velvet drapes windows blue neon sign near door said : TONY ’ RESTAURANT FINE FOOD AND DRINK . KEEP OUT . The words blue neon sign surprised mildly instant . Nothing warped seemed bizarre strange , distorted surroundings . The tops sheer buildings slanted weird , surrealistic perspective , street seemed tilted . He raised collar warm woolen coat hugged around . The night raw . A boy thin shirt thin tattered trousers walked darkness bare feet . The boy black hair needed haircut shoes socks . His sickly face pale sad . His feet made grisly , soft , sucking sounds rain puddles wet pavement passed , Yossarian moved intense pity poverty wanted smash pale , sad , sickly face fist knock existence brought mind pale , sad , sickly children Italy night needed haircuts needed shoes socks . He made Yossarian think cripples cold hungry men women , dumb , passive , devout mothers catatonic eyes nursing infants outdoors night chilled animal udders bared insensibly raw rain . Cows . Almost cue , nursing mother padded past holding infant black rags , Yossarian wanted smash , reminded barefoot boy thin shirt thin , tattered trousers shivering , stupefying misery world never yet provided enough heat food justice ingenious unscrupulous handful . What lousy earth ! He wondered many people destitute night even prosperous country , many homes shanties , many husbands drunk wives socked , many children bullied , abused abandoned . How many families hungered food could afford buy ? How many hearts broken ? How many suicides would take place night , many people would go insane ? How many cockroaches landlords would triumph ? How many winners losers , successes failures , rich men poor men ? How many wise guys stupid ? How many happy endings unhappy endings ? How many honest men liars , brave men cowards , loyal men traitors , many sainted men corrupt , many people positions trust sold souls blackguards petty cash , many never souls ? How many straight-and-narrow paths crooked paths ? How many best families worst families many good people bad people ? When added subtracted , might left children , perhaps Albert Einstein old violinist sculptor somewhere . Yossarian walked lonely torture , feeling estranged , could wipe mind excruciating image barefoot boy sickly cheeks turned corner avenue finally came upon Allied soldier convulsions ground , young lieutenant small , pale , boyish face . Six soldiers different countries wrestled different parts , striving help hold still . He yelped groaned unintelligibly clenched teeth , eyes rolled head . “ Don ’ let bite tongue , ” short sergeant near Yossarian advised shrewdly , seventh man threw fray wrestle ill lieutenant ’ face . All wrestlers turned undecidedly , held young lieutenant rigid know . A quiver moronic panic spread one straining brute face another . “ Why ’ lift put hood car ? ” corporal standing back Yossarian drawled . That seemed make sense , seven men lifted young lieutenant stretched carefully hood parked car , still pinning struggling part . Once stretched hood parked car , stared uneasily , idea next . “ Why ’ lift hood car lay ground ? ” drawled corporal behind Yossarian . That seemed like good idea , , began move back sidewalk , could finish , jeep raced flashing red spotlight side two military policemen front seat . “ What ’ going ? ” driver yelled . “ He ’ convulsions , ” one men grappling one young lieutenant ’ limbs answered . “ We ’ holding still. ” “ That ’ good . He ’ arrest. ” “ What ? ” “ Keep arrest ! ” M.P . shouted , doubling raucous laughter jest , sped away jeep . Yossarian recalled leave papers moved prudently past strange group toward sound muffled voices emanating distance inside murky darkness ahead . The broad , rain-blotched boulevard illuminated every half-block short , curling lampposts eerie , shimmering glares surrounded smoky brown mist . From window overhead heard unhappy female voice pleading , “ Please ’ . Please ’ t. ” A despondent young woman black raincoat much black hair face passed eyes lowered . At Ministry Public Affairs next block , drunken lady backed one fluted Corinthian columns drunken young soldier , three drunken comrades arms sat watching nearby steps wine bottles standing legs . “ Pleeshe ’ , ” begged drunken lady . “ I want go home . Pleeshe ’ t. ” One sitting men cursed pugnaciously hurled wine bottle Yossarian turned look . The bottle shattered harmlessly far away brief muted noise . Yossarian continued walking away listless , unhurried pace , hands buried pockets . “ Come , baby , ” heard drunken soldier urge determinedly . “ It ’ turn now. ” “ Pleeshe ’ , ” begged drunken lady . “ Pleeshe ’ t. ” At next corner , deep inside dense , impenetrable shadows narrow , winding side street , heard mysterious , unmistakable sound someone shoveling snow . The measured , labored , evocative scrape iron shovel concrete made flesh crawl terror stepped curb cross ominous alley hurried onward haunting , incongruous noise left behind . Now knew : soon , continued without turning , would come dry fountain middle boulevard , officers ’ apartment seven blocks beyond . He heard snarling , inhuman voices cutting ghostly blackness front suddenly . The bulb corner lamp post died , spilling gloom half street , throwing everything visible balance . On side intersection , man beating dog stick like man beating horse whip Raskolnikov ’ dream . Yossarian strained helplessly see hear . The dog whimpered squealed brute , dumbfounded hysteria end old Manila rope groveled crawled belly without resisting , man beat beat anyway heavy , flat stick . A small crowd watched . A squat woman stepped asked please stop . “ Mind business , ” man barked gruffly , lifting stick though might beat , woman retreated sheepishly abject humiliated air . Yossarian quickened pace get away , almost ran . The night filled horrors , thought knew Christ must felt walked world , like psychiatrist ward full nuts , like victim prison full thieves . What welcome sight leper must ! At next corner man beating small boy brutally midst immobile crowd adult spectators made effort intervene . Yossarian recoiled sickening recognition . He certain witnessed horrible scene sometime . Déjà vu ? The sinister coincidence shook filled doubt dread . It scene witnessed block , although everything seemed quite different . What world happening ? Would squat woman step ask man please stop ? Would raise hand strike would retreat ? Nobody moved . The child cried steadily though drugged misery . The man kept knocking hard , resounding open-palm blows head , jerking feet order knock . No one sullen , cowering crowd seemed care enough stunned beaten boy interfere . The child nine . One drab woman weeping silently dirty dish towel . The boy emaciated needed haircut . Bright-red blood streaming ears . Yossarian crossed quickly side immense avenue escape nauseating sight found walking human teeth lying drenched , glistening pavement near splotches blood kept sticky pelting raindrops poking one like sharp fingernails . Molars broken incisors lay scattered everywhere . He circled tiptoe grotesque debris came near doorway containing crying soldier holding saturated handkerchief mouth , supported sagged two soldiers waiting grave impatience military ambulance finally came clanging amber fog lights passed altercation next block civilian Italian books slew civilian policemen armlocks clubs . The screaming , struggling civilian dark man face white flour fear . His eyes pulsating hectic desperation , flapping like bat ’ wings , many tall policemen seized arms legs lifted . His books spilled ground . “ Help ! ” shrieked shrilly voice strangling emotion , policemen carried open doors rear ambulance threw inside . “ Police ! Help ! Police ! ” The doors shut bolted , ambulance raced away . There humorless irony ludicrous panic man screaming help police policemen around . Yossarian smiled wryly futile ridiculous cry aid , saw start words ambiguous , realized alarm , perhaps , intended call police heroic warning grave doomed friend everyone policeman club gun mob policemen clubs guns back . “ Help ! Police ! ” man cried , could shouting danger . Yossarian responded thought slipping away stealthily police almost tripped feet burly woman forty hastening across intersection guiltily , darting furtive , vindictive glances behind toward woman eighty thick , bandaged ankles doddering losing pursuit . The old woman gasping breath minced along muttering distracted agitation . There mistaking nature scene ; chase . The triumphant first woman halfway across wide avenue second woman reached curb . The nasty , small , gloating smile glanced back laboring old woman wicked apprehensive . Yossarian knew could help troubled old woman would cry , knew could spring forward capture sturdy first woman hold mob policemen nearby second woman would give license shriek distress . But old woman passed without even seeing , mumbling terrible , tragic vexation , soon first woman vanished deepening layers darkness old woman left standing helplessly center thoroughfare , dazed , uncertain way proceed , alone . Yossarian tore eyes hurried away shame done nothing assist . He darted furtive , guilty glances back fled defeat , afraid old woman might start following , welcomed concealing shelter drizzling , drifting , lightless , nearly opaque gloom . Mobs… mobs policemen-everything England hands mobs , mobs , mobs . Mobs clubs control everywhere . The surface collar shoulders Yossarian ’ coat soaked . His socks wet cold . The light next lamppost , , glass globe broken . Buildings featureless shapes flowed noiselessly though borne past immutably surface rank timeless tide . A tall monk passed , face buried entirely inside coarse gray cowl , even eyes hidden . Footsteps sloshed toward steadily puddle , feared would another barefoot child . He brushed gaunt , cadaverous , tristful man black raincoat star-shaped scar cheek glossy mutilated depression size egg one temple . On squishing straw sandals , young woman materialized whole face disfigured God-awful pink piebald burn started neck stretched raw , corrugated mass cheeks past eyes ! Yossarian could bear look , shuddered . No one would ever love . His spirit sick ; longed lie girl could love would soothe excite put sleep . A mob club waiting Pianosa . The girls gone . The countess daughter-in-law longer good enough ; grown old fun , longer time . Luciana gone , dead , probably ; yet , soon enough . Aarfy ’ buxom trollop vanished smutty cameo ring , Nurse Duckett ashamed refused fly combat missions would cause scandal . The girl knew nearby plain maid officers ’ apartment , none men ever slept . Her name Michaela , men called filthy things dulcet , ingratiating voices , giggled childish joy understood English thought flattering making harmless jokes . Everything wild watched filled enchanted delight . She happy , simple-minded , hard-working girl could read barely able write name . Her straight hair color rotting straw . She sallow skin myopic eyes , none men ever slept none men ever wanted , none Aarfy , raped evening held prisoner clothes closet almost two hours hand mouth civilian curfew sirens sounded unlawful outside . Then threw window . Her dead body still lying pavement Yossarian arrived pushed way politely circle solemn neighbors dim lanterns , glared venom shrank away pointed bitterly toward second-floor windows private , grim , accusing conversations . Yossarian ’ heart pounded fright horror pitiful , ominous , gory spectacle broken corpse . He ducked hallway bolted stairs apartment , found Aarfy pacing uneasily pompous , slightly uncomfortable smile . Aarfy seemed bit unsettled fidgeted pipe assured Yossarian everything going right . There nothing worry . “ I raped , ” explained . Yossarian aghast . “ But killed , Aarfy ! You killed ! ” “ Oh , I I raped , ” Aarfy replied condescending manner . “ I ’ well let go around saying bad things us , could I ? ” “ But touch , dumb bastard ? ” Yossarian shouted . “ Why ’ get girl street wanted one ? The city full prostitutes. ” “ Oh , , , ” Aarfy bragged . “ I never paid life. ” “ Aarfy , insane ? ” Yossarian almost speechless . “ You killed girl . They ’ going put jail ! ” “ Oh , , ” Aarfy answered forced smile . “ Not . They ’ going put good old Aarfy jail . Not killing her. ” “ But threw window . She ’ lying dead street. ” “ She right , ” Aarfy answered . “ It ’ curfew. ” “ Stupid ! Don ’ realize ’ done ? ” Yossarian wanted grab Aarfy well-fed , caterpillar-soft shoulders shake sense . “ You ’ murdered human . They going put jail . They might even hang ! ” “ Oh , I hardly think ’ , ” Aarfy replied jovial chuckle , although symptoms nervousness increased . He spilled tobacco crumbs unconsciously short fingers fumbled bowl pipe . “ No , sirree . Not good old Aarfy. ” He chortled . “ She servant girl . I hardly think ’ going make much fuss one poor Italian servant girl many thousands lives lost every day . Do ? ” “ Listen ! ” Yossarian cried , almost joy . He pricked ears watched blood drain Aarfy ’ face sirens mourned far away , police sirens , ascended almost instantaneously howling , strident , onrushing cacophony overwhelming sound seemed crash room around every side . “ Aarfy , ’ coming , ” said flood compassion , shouting heard noise . “ They ’ coming arrest . Aarfy , ’ understand ? You ’ take life another human get away , even poor servant girl . Don ’ see ? Can ’ understand ? ” “ Oh , , ” Aarfy insisted lame laugh weak smile . “ They ’ coming arrest . Not good old Aarfy. ” All looked sick . He sank chair trembling stupor , stumpy , lax hands quaking lap . Cars skidded stop outside . Spotlights hit windows immediately . Car doors slammed police whistles screeched . Voices rose harshly . Aarfy green . He kept shaking head mechanically queer , numb smile repeating weak , hollow monotone coming , good old Aarfy , sirree , striving convince even heavy footsteps raced stairs pounded across landing , even fists beat door four times deafening , inexorable force . Then door apartment flew open , two large , tough , brawny M.P.s icy eyes firm , sinewy , unsmiling jaws entered quickly , strode across room , arrested Yossarian . They arrested Yossarian Rome without pass . They apologized Aarfy intruding led Yossarian away , gripping arm fingers hard steel manacles . They said nothing way . Two tall M.P.s clubs hard white helmets waiting outside closed car . They marched Yossarian back seat , car roared away weaved rain muddy fog police station . The M.P.s locked night cell four stone walls . At dawn gave pail latrine drove airport , two giant M.P.s clubs white helmets waiting transport plane whose engines already warming arrived , cylindrical green cowlings oozing quivering beads condensation . None M.P.s said anything either . They even nod . Yossarian never seen granite faces . The plane flew Pianosa . Two silent M.P.s waiting landing strip . There eight , filed precise , wordless discipline two cars sped humming tires past four squadron areas Group Headquarters building , still two M.P.s waiting parking area . All ten tall , strong , purposeful , silent men towered around turned toward entrance . Their footsteps crunched loud unison cindered ground . He impression accelerating haste . He terrified . Every one ten M.P.s seemed powerful enough bash death single blow . They press massive , toughened , boulderous shoulders crush life body . There nothing could save . He could even see two gripping arms marched rapidly two tight single-file columns formed . Their pace quickened , felt though flying along feet ground trotted resolute cadence wide marble staircase upper landing , still two inscrutable military policemen hard faces waiting lead even faster pace long , cantilevered balcony overhanging immense lobby . Their marching footsteps dull tile floor thundered like awesome , quickening drum roll vacant center building moved even greater speed precision toward Colonel Cathcart ’ office , violent winds panic began blowing Yossarian ’ ears turned toward doom inside office , Colonel Korn , rump spreading comfortably corner Colonel Cathcart ’ desk , sat waiting greet genial smile said , “ We ’ sending home. ” 40 CATCH-22 There , course , catch . “ Catch-22 ? ” inquired Yossarian . “ Of course , ” Colonel Korn answered pleasantly , chased mighty guard massive M.P.s insouciant flick hand slightly contemptuous nod-most relaxed , always , could cynical . His rimless square eyeglasses glinted sly amusement gazed Yossarian . “ After , ’ simply send home refusing fly missions keep rest men , ? That would hardly fair them. ” “ You ’ goddam right ! ” Colonel Cathcart blurted , lumbering back forth gracelessly like winded bull , puffing pouting angrily . “ I ’ like tie hand foot throw aboard plane every mission . That ’ I ’ like do. ” Colonel Korn motioned Colonel Cathcart silent smiled Yossarian . “ You know , really making things terribly difficult Colonel Cathcart , ” observed flip good humor , though fact displease . “ The men unhappy morale beginning deteriorate . And ’ fault. ” “ It ’ fault , ” Yossarian argued , “ raising number missions. ” “ No , ’ fault refusing fly , ” Colonel Korn retorted . “ The men perfectly content fly many missions asked long thought alternative . Now ’ given hope , ’ unhappy . So blame yours. ” “ Doesn ’ know ’ war going ? ” Colonel Cathcart , still stamping back forth , demanded morosely without looking Yossarian . “ I ’ quite sure , ” Colonel Korn answered . “ That ’ probably refuses fly them. ” “ Doesn ’ make difference ? ” “ Will knowledge ’ war going weaken decision refuse participate ? ” Colonel Korn inquired sarcastic seriousness , mocking Colonel Cathcart . “ No , sir , ” Yossarian replied , almost returning Colonel Korn ’ smile . “ I afraid , ” Colonel Korn remarked elaborate sigh , locking fingers together comfortably top smooth , bald , broad , shiny brown head . “ You know , fairness , really ’ treated badly , ? We ’ fed paid time . We gave medal even made captain. ” “ I never made captain , ” Colonel Cathcart exclaimed bitterly . “ I given court-martial loused Ferrara mission went around twice. ” “ I told promote , ” said Colonel Korn , “ ’ listen me. ” “ No ’ . You told promote , ’ ? ” “ I told promote . But ’ listen. ” “ I listened. ” “ You never listen , ” Colonel Korn persisted relish . “ That ’ reason ’ spot. ” “ All right , gee whiz . Stop rubbing , ? ” Colonel Cathcart burrowed fists deep inside pockets turned away slouch . “ Instead picking , ’ figure ’ going ? ” “ We ’ going send home , I ’ afraid. ” Colonel Korn chuckling triumphantly turned away Colonel Cathcart face Yossarian . “ Yossarian , war . We ’ going send home . You really ’ deserve , know , one reasons I ’ mind . Since ’ nothing else risk time , ’ decided return States . We ’ worked little deal to- “ “ What kind deal ? ” Yossarian demanded defiant mistrust . Colonel Korn tossed head back laughed . “ Oh , thoroughly despicable deal , make mistake . It ’ absolutely revolting . But ’ accept quickly enough. ” “ Don ’ sure. ” “ I ’ slightest doubt , even though stinks high heaven . Oh , way . You ’ told men ’ refused fly missions , ? ” “ No , sir , ” Yossarian answered promptly . Colonel Korn nodded approvingly . “ That ’ good . I like way lie . You ’ go far world ever acquire decent ambition. ” “ Doesn ’ know ’ war going ? ” Colonel Cathcart yelled suddenly , blew vigorous disbelief open end cigarette holder . “ I ’ quite sure , ” Colonel Korn replied acidly , “ since brought identical point attention moment ago. ” Colonel Korn frowned wearily Yossarian ’ benefit , eyes twinkling swarthily sly daring scorn . Gripping edge Colonel Cathcart ’ desk hands , lifted flaccid haunches far back corner sit short legs dangling freely . His shoes kicked lightly yellow oak wood , sludge-brown socks , garterless , collapsed sagging circles ankles surprisingly small white . “ You know , Yossarian , ” mused affably manner casual reflection seemed derisive sincere , “ I really admire bit . You ’ intelligent person great moral character taken courageous stand . I ’ intelligent person moral character , I ’ ideal position appreciate it. ” “ These critical times , ” Colonel Cathcart asserted petulantly far corner office , paying attention Colonel Korn . “ Very critical times indeed , ” Colonel Korn agreed placid nod . “ We ’ change command , ’ afford situation might put us bad light either General Scheisskopf General Peckem . Isn ’ mean , Colonel ? ” “ Hasn ’ got patriotism ? ” “ Won ’ fight country ? ” Colonel Korn demanded , emulating Colonel Cathcart ’ harsh , self-righteous tone . “ Won ’ give life Colonel Cathcart ? ” Yossarian tensed alert astonishment heard Colonel Korn ’ concluding words . “ What ’ ? ” exclaimed . “ What Colonel Cathcart got country ? You ’ same. ” “ How separate us ? ” Colonel Korn inquired ironical tranquillity . “ That ’ right , ” Colonel Cathcart cried emphatically . “ You ’ either us us . There ’ two ways it. ” “ I ’ afraid ’ got , ” added Colonel Korn . “ You ’ either us country . It ’ simple that. ” “ Oh , , Colonel . I ’ buy that. ” Colonel Korn unrufed . “ Neither I , frankly , everyone else . So are. ” “ You ’ disgrace uniform ! ” Colonel Cathcart declared blustering wrath , whirling confront Yossarian first time . “ I ’ like know ever got captain , anyway. ” “ You promoted , ” Colonel Korn reminded sweetly , stifling snicker . “ Don ’ remember ? ” “ Well , I never done it. ” “ I told , ” Colonel Korn said . “ But ’ listen me. ” “ Gee whiz , stop rubbing ? ” Colonel Cathcart cried . He furrowed brow glowered Colonel Korn eyes narrow suspicion , fists clenched hips . “ Say , whose side , anyway ? ” “ Your side , Colonel . What side could I ? ” “ Then stop picking , ? Get back , ? ” “ I ’ side , Colonel . I ’ loaded patriotism. ” “ Well , make sure ’ forget that. ” Colonel Cathcart turned away grudgingly another moment , incompletely reassured , began striding floor , hands kneading long cigarette holder . He jerked thumb toward Yossarian . “ Let ’ settle . I know I ’ like . I ’ like take outside shoot . That ’ I ’ like . That ’ General Dreedle would him. ” “ But General Dreedle ’ us , ” said Colonel Korn , “ ’ take outside shoot him. ” Now moment tension Colonel Cathcart passed , Colonel Korn relaxed resumed kicking softly Colonel Cathcart ’ desk . He returned Yossarian . “ So ’ going send home instead . It took bit thinking , finally worked horrible little plan sending home without causing much dissatisfaction among friends ’ leave behind . Doesn ’ make happy ? ” “ What kind plan ? I ’ sure I ’ going like it. ” “ I know ’ going like it. ” Colonel Korn laughed , locking hands contentedly top head . “ You ’ going loathe . It really odious certainly offend conscience . But ’ agree quickly enough . You ’ agree send home safe sound two weeks , choice . It ’ court-martial . Take leave it. ” Yossarian snorted . “ Stop bluffing , Colonel . You ’ court-martial desertion face enemy . It would make look bad probably ’ get conviction. ” “ But court-martial desertion duty , since went Rome without pass . And could make stick . If think minute , ’ see ’ leave us alternative . We ’ simply let keep walking around open insubordination without punishing . All men would stop flying missions , . No , word . We court-martial turn deal , even though would raise lot questions terrible black eye Colonel Cathcart. ” Colonel Cathcart winced words “ black eye ” , without apparent premeditation , hurled slender onyx-and-ivory cigarette holder viciously wooden surface desk . “ Jesus Christ ! ” shouted unexpectedly . “ I hate goddam cigarette holder ! ” The cigarette holder bounced desk wall , ricocheted across window sill floor came stop almost standing . Colonel Cathcart stared irascible scowl . “ I wonder ’ really good. ” “ It ’ feather cap General Peckem , black eye General Scheisskopf , ” Colonel Korn informed mischievous look innocence . “ Well , one I supposed please ? ” “ Both. ” “ How I please ? They hate . How I ever going get feather cap General Scheisskopf without getting black eye General Peckem ? ” “ March. ” “ Yeah , march . That ’ way please . March . March. ” Colonel Cathcart grimaced sullenly . “ Some generals ! They ’ disgrace uniforms . If people like two make general , I ’ see I miss. ” “ You ’ going go far. ” Colonel Korn assured flat lack conviction , turned back chuckling Yossarian , disdainful merriment increasing sight Yossarian ’ unyielding expression antagonism distrust . “ And crux situation . Colonel Cathcart wants general I want colonel , ’ send home. ” “ Why want general ? ” “ Why ? For reason I want colonel . What else got ? Everyone teaches us aspire higher things . A general higher colonel , colonel higher lieutenant colonel . So ’ aspiring . And know , Yossarian , ’ lucky thing . Your timing absolutely perfect , I suppose took factor account calculations. ” “ I ’ calculating , ” Yossarian retorted . “ Yes , I really enjoy way lie , ” Colonel Korn answered . “ Won ’ make proud commanding officer promoted general-to know served outfit averaged combat missions per person ? Don ’ want earn unit citations oak leaf clusters Air Medal ? Where ’ ‘ sprit de corps ? ’ Don ’ want contribute great record flying combat missions ? It ’ last chance answer yes. ” “ No. ” “ In case , us barrel- “ said Colonel Korn without rancor . “ He ought ashamed ! ” “ -and send home . Just little things us , and- “ “ What sort things ? ” Yossarian interrupted belligerent misgiving . “ Oh , tiny , insignificant things . Really , generous deal ’ making . We issue orders returning States-really , will-and return is… ” “ What ? What must I ? ” Colonel Korn laughed curtly . “ Like us. ” Yossarian blinked . “ Like ? ” “ Like us. ” “ Like ? ” “ That ’ right , ” said Colonel Korn , nodding , gratified immeasurably Yossarian ’ guileless surprise bewilderment . “ Like us . Join us . Be pal . Say nice things us back States . Become one boys . Now , ’ asking much , ? ” “ You want like ? Is ? ” “ That ’ all. ” “ That ’ ? ” “ Just find heart like us. ” Yossarian wanted laugh confidently saw amazement Colonel Korn telling truth . “ That ’ going easy , ” sneered . “ Oh , lot easier think , ” Colonel Korn taunted return , undismayed Yossarian ’ barb . “ You ’ surprised easy ’ find like us begin. ” Colonel Korn hitched waist loose , voluminous trousers . The deep black grooves isolating square chin jowls bent kind jeering reprehensible mirth . “ You see , Yossarian , ’ going put easy street . We ’ going promote major even give another medal .

A whole new world luxury awaits become pal . Isn ’ lovely ? ” Yossarian found listening intently fascinating elucidation details . “ I ’ sure I want make speeches. ” “ Then ’ forget speeches . The important thing say people here. ” Colonel Korn leaned forward earnestly , longer smiling . “ We ’ want men group know ’ sending home result refusal fly missions . And ’ want General Peckem General Scheisskopf get wind friction us , either . That ’ ’ going become good pals. ” “ What I say men asked I refused fly missions ? ” “ Tell informed confidence returned States unwilling risk life another mission two .

No one would believe , Army ’ let , world want ? You ’ going one boys , remember ? You ’ enjoy rich , rewarding , luxurious , privileged existence . You ’ fool throw away moral principle , ’ fool . Is deal ? ” “ I ’ know. ” “ It ’ court-martial. ” “ That ’ pretty scummy trick I ’ playing men squadron , ’ ? ” “ Odious , ” Colonel Korn agreed amiably , waited , watching Yossarian patiently glimmer private delight . “ But hell ! ” Yossarian exclaimed . “ If ’ want fly missions , let stand something way I . Right ? ” “ Of course , ” said Colonel Korn . “ There ’ reason I risk life , ? ” “ Of course not. ” Yossarian arrived decision swift grin . “ It ’ deal ! ” announced jubilantly . “ Great , ” said Colonel Korn somewhat less cordiality Yossarian expected , slid Colonel Cathcart ’ desk stand floor . He tugged folds cloth pants undershorts free crotch gave Yossarian limp hand shake . “ Welcome aboard. ” “ Thanks , Colonel . I- “ “ Call Blackie , John . We ’ pals now. ” “ Sure , Blackie .

He home free : pulled ; act rebellion succeeded ; safe , nothing ashamed anyone . He started toward staircase jaunty exhilarated air . A private green fatigues saluted . Yossarian returned salute happily , staring private curiosity . He looked strangely familiar . When Yossarian returned salute , private green fatigues turned suddenly Nately ’ whore lunged murderously bone-handled kitchen knife caught side upraised arm . Yossarian sank floor shriek , shutting eyes overwhelming terror saw girl lift knife strike . He already unconscious Colonel Korn Colonel Cathcart dashed office saved life frightening away . 41 SNOWDEN “ Cut , ” said doctor . “ You cut , ” said another . “ No cuts , ” said Yossarian thick , unwieldy tongue . “ Now look ’ butting , ” complained one doctors . “ Another county heard .

They found cat face. ” “ Poor bastard , ” Yossarian said , began cry , hiding tears crook shoulder . The chaplain left without saying goodbye . Yossarian ate something went sleep . A hand shook awake middle night . He opened eyes saw thin , mean man patient ’ bathrobe pajamas looked nasty smirk jeered . “ We ’ got pal , buddy . We ’ got pal. ” Yossarian unnerved . “ What hell talking ? ” pleaded incipient panic . “ You ’ find , buddy . You ’ find out. ” Yossarian lunged tormentor ’ throat one hand , man glided reach effortlessly vanished corridor malicious laugh . Yossarian lay trembling pounding pulse . He bathed icy sweat . He wondered pal . It dark hospital perfectly quiet . He watch tell time . He wide-awake , knew prisoner one sleepless , bedridden nights would take eternity dissolve dawn . A throbbing chill oozed legs . He cold , thought Snowden , never pal vaguely familiar kid badly wounded freezing death puddle harsh yellow sunlight splashing face side gunport Yossarian crawled rear section plane bomb bay Dobbs beseeched intercom help gunner , please help gunner . Yossarian ’ stomach turned eyes first beheld macabre scene ; absolutely revolted , paused fright moments descending , crouched hands knees narrow tunnel bomb bay beside sealed corrugated carton containing first-aid kit . Snowden lying back floor legs stretched , still burdened cumbersomely flak suit , flak helmet , parachute harness Mae West . Not far away floor lay small tail-gunner dead faint . The wound Yossarian saw outside Snowden ’ thigh , large deep football , seemed . It impossible tell shreds saturated coveralls ended ragged flesh began . There morphine first-aid kit , protection Snowden pain numbing shock gaping wound . The twelve syrettes morphine stolen case replaced cleanly lettered note said : “ What ’ good M amp ; M Enterprises good country . Milo Minderbinder. ” Yossarian swore Milo held two aspirins ashen lips unable receive . But first hastily drew tourniquet around Snowden ’ thigh could think else first tumultuous moments senses turmoil , knew must act competently feared might go pieces completely . Snowden watched steadily , saying nothing . No artery spurting , Yossarian pretended absorb entirely fashioning tourniquet , applying tourniquet something know . He worked simulated skill composure , feeling Snowden ’ lack-luster gaze resting upon . He recovered possession tourniquet finished loosened immediately lessen danger gangrene . His mind clear , knew proceed . He rummaged first-aid kit scissors . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden said softly . “ I ’ cold. ” “ You ’ going right , kid , ” Yossarian reassured grin . “ You ’ going right. ” “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden said frail , childlike voice . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian said , know else say . “ There , there. ” “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , .

He cut heavy gabardine cloth way around thigh straight line . The tiny tailgunner woke Yossarian cutting scissors , saw , fainted . Snowden rolled head side neck order stare Yossarian directly . A dim , sunken light glowed weak listless eyes . Yossarian , puzzled , tried look . He began cutting downward coveralls along inside seam . The yawning wound-was tube slimy bone saw running deep inside gory scarlet flow behind twitching , startling fibers weird muscle ? – dripping blood several trickles , like snow melting eaves , viscous red , already thickening dropped . Yossarian kept cutting coveralls bottom peeled open severed leg garment . It fell floor plop , exposing hem khaki undershorts soaking blotches blood one side though thirst . Yossarian stunned waxen ghastly Snowden ’ bare leg looked , loathsome , lifeless esoteric downy , fine , curled blond hairs odd white shin calf . The wound , saw , nearly large football , long wide hand raw deep see clearly . The raw muscles inside twitched like live hamburger meat . A long sigh relief escaped slowly Yossarian ’ mouth saw Snowden danger dying . The blood already coagulating inside wound , simply matter bandaging keeping calm plane landed . He removed packets sulfanilamide first-aid kit . Snowden quivered Yossarian pressed gently turn slightly side . “ Did I hurt ? ” “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian said . “ There , there. ” “ I ’ cold .

Yossarian scrambled frantically first-aid kit search morphine found Milo ’ note bottle aspirin . He cursed Milo held two aspirin tablets Snowden . He water offer . Snowden rejected aspirin almost imperceptible shake head . His face pale pasty . Yossarian removed Snowden ’ flak helmet lowered head floor . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden moaned half-closed eyes . “ I ’ cold. ” The edges mouth turning blue . Yossarian petrified . He wondered whether pull rip cord Snowden ’ parachute cover nylon folds . It warm plane . Glancing unexpectedly , Snowden gave wan , co-operative smile shifted position hips bit Yossarian could begin salting wound sulfanilamide . Yossarian worked renewed confidence optimism . The plane bounced hard inside air pocket , remembered start left parachute front nose . There nothing done . He poured envelope envelope white crystalline powder bloody oval wound nothing red could seen drew deep , apprehensive breath , steeling gritted teeth touched bare hand dangling shreds drying flesh tuck inside wound . Quickly covered whole wound large cotton compress jerked hand away . He smiled nervously brief ordeal ended . The actual contact dead flesh nearly repulsive anticipated , found excuse caress wound fingers convince courage . Next began binding compress place roll gauze . The second time around Snowden ’ thigh bandage , spotted small hole inside piece flak entered , round , crinkled wound size quarter blue edges black core inside blood crusted .

It good bandage , knew , sat back heels pride , wiping perspiration brow , grinned Snowden spontaneous friendliness . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden moaned . “ I ’ cold. ” “ You ’ going right , kid , ” Yossarian assured , patting arm comfortingly . “ Everything ’ control. ” Snowden shook head feebly . “ I ’ cold , ” repeated , eyes dull blind stone . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” said Yossarian , growing doubt trepidation . “ There , . In little ’ back ground Doc Daneeka take care you. ” But Snowden kept shaking head pointed last , barest movement chin , toward armpit . Yossarian bent forward peer saw strangely colored stain seeping coveralls armhole Snowden ’ flak suit . Yossarian felt heart stop , pound violently found difficult breathe . Snowden wounded inside flak suit . Yossarian ripped open snaps Snowden ’ flak suit heard scream wildly Snowden ’ insides slithered floor soggy pile kept dripping . A chunk flak three inches big shot side underneath arm blasted way , drawing whole mottled quarts Snowden along gigantic hole ribs made blasted . Yossarian screamed second time squeezed hands eyes . His teeth chattering horror . He forced look . Here God ’ plenty , right , thought bitterly stared-liver , lungs , kidneys , ribs , stomach bits stewed tomatoes Snowden eaten day lunch . Yossarian hated stewed tomatoes turned away dizzily began vomit , clutching burning throat . The tail gunner woke Yossarian vomiting , saw , fainted . Yossarian limp exhaustion , pain despair finished . He turned back weakly Snowden , whose breath grown softer rapid , whose face grown paler . He wondered world begin save . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden whimpered . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” Yossarian mumbled mechanically voice low heard . “ There , there. ” Yossarian cold , , shivering uncontrollably . He felt goose pimples clacking gazed despondently grim secret Snowden spilled messy floor . It easy read message entrails . Man matter , Snowden ’ secret . Drop window ’ fall . Set fire ’ burn .

Ripeness . “ I ’ cold , ” Snowden said . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , , ” said Yossarian . “ There , there. ” He pulled rip cord Snowden ’ parachute covered body white nylon sheets . “ I ’ cold. ” “ There , there. ” 42 YOSSARIAN “ Colonel Korn says , ” said Major Danby Yossarian prissy , gratified smile , “ deal still . Everything working fine. ” “ No ’ t. ” “ Oh , yes , indeed , ” Major Danby insisted benevolently . “ In fact , everything much better . It really stroke luck almost murdered girl . Now deal go perfectly. ” “ I ’ making deals Colonel Korn. ” Major Danby ’ effervescent optimism vanished instantly , broke bubbling sweat . “ But deal , ’ ? ” asked anguished puzzlement . “ Don ’ agreement ? ” “ I ’ breaking agreement. ” “ But shook hands , ’ ? You gave word gentleman. ” “ I ’ breaking word. ” “ Oh , dear , ” sighed Major Danby , began dabbing ineffectually careworn brow folded white handkerchief . “ But , Yossarian ? It ’ good deal ’ offering you. ” “ It ’ lousy deal , Danby . It ’ odious deal. ” “ Oh , dear , ” Major Danby fretted , running bare hand dark , wiry hair , already soaked perspiration tops thick , close-cropped waves . “ Oh dear. ” “ Danby , ’ think ’ odious ? ” Major Danby pondered moment . “ Yes , I suppose odious , ” conceded reluctance . His globular , exophthalmic eyes quite distraught . “ But make deal ’ like ? ” “ I moment weakness , ” Yossarian wisecracked glum irony . “ I trying save life. ” “ Don ’ want save life ? ” “ That ’ I ’ let make fly missions. ” “ Then let send home ’ danger. ” “ Let send home I flew fifty missions , ” Yossarian said , “ I stabbed girl , I ’ turned stubborn son bitch. ” Major Danby shook head emphatically sincere bespectacled vexation . “ They ’ send nearly every man home . Most men fifty missions . Colonel Cathcart ’ possibly requisition many inexperienced replacement crews one time without causing investigation . He ’ caught trap. ” “ That ’ problem. ” “ No , , , Yossarian , ” Major Danby disagreed solicitously . “ It ’ problem . Because ’ go deal , ’ going institute court-martial proceedings soon sign hospital. ” Yossarian thumbed nose Major Danby laughed smug elation . “ The hell ! Don ’ lie , Danby . They ’ even try. ” “ But ’ ? ” inquired Major Danby , blinking astonishment . “ Because I ’ really got barrel . There ’ official report says I stabbed Nazi assassin trying kill . They ’ certainly look silly trying court-martial that. ” “ But , Yossarian ! ” Major Danby exclaimed . “ There ’ another official report says stabbed innocent girl course extensive black-market operations involving acts sabotage sale military secrets enemy. ” Yossarian taken back severely surprise disappointment . “ Another official report ? ” “ Yossarian , prepare many official reports want choose whichever ones need given occasion .

It ’ best everyone way. ” “ It ’ best Cathcart , Korn , everyone. ” “ For everyone , ” Major Danby insisted . “ It solve whole problem. ” “ Is best men group keep flying missions ? ” Major Danby flinched turned face away uncomfortably second . “ Yossarian , ” replied , “ help nobody force Colonel Cathcart court-martial prove guilty crimes ’ charged . You go prison long time , whole life ruined. ” Yossarian listened growing feeling concern . “ What crimes charge ? ” “ Incompetence Ferrara , insubordination , refusal engage enemy combat ordered , desertion. ” Yossarian sucked cheeks soberly . “ They could charge , could ? They gave medal Ferrara . How could charge incompetence ? ” “ Aarfy swear McWatt lied official report. ” “ I ’ bet bastard would ! ” “ They also find guilty , ” Major Danby recited , “ rape , extensive black-market operations , acts sabotage sale military secrets enemy. ” “ How prove ? I never single one things. ” “ But witnesses swear . They get witnesses need simply persuading destroying good country . And way , would good country. ” “ In way ? ” Yossarian demanded , rising slowly one elbow bridling hostility . Major Danby drew back bit began mopping forehead . “ Well , Yossarian , ” began apologetic stammer , “ would help war effort bring Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn disrepute . Let ’ face , Yossarian-in spite everything , group good record . If court-martialed found innocent , men would probably refuse fly missions , . Colonel Cathcart would disgrace , military efficiency unit might destroyed . So way would good country found guilty put prison , even though innocent. ” “ What sweet way putting things ! ” Yossarian snapped caustic resentment . Major Danby turned red squirmed squinted uneasily . “ Please ’ blame , ” pleaded look anxious integrity . “ You know ’ fault . All I ’ trying look things objectively arrive solution difficult situation. ” “ I ’ create situation. ” “ But resolve . And else ? You ’ want fly missions. ” “ I run away. ” “ Run away ? ” “ Desert .

And I could hide there. ” “ And live danger every minute life would find ? No , , , , Yossarian . That would disastrous ignoble thing . Running away problems never solved . Please believe . I trying help you. ” “ That ’ kind detective said decided jab thumb wound , ” Yossarian retorted sarcastically . “ I detective , ” Major Danby replied indignation , cheeks flushing . “ I ’ university professor highly developed sense right wrong , I ’ try deceive . I ’ lie anyone. ” “ What would one men group asked conversation ? ” “ I would lie him. ” Yossarian laughed mockingly , Major Danby , despite blushing discomfort , leaned back relief , though welcoming respite Yossarian ’ changing mood promised . Yossarian gazed mixture reserved pity contempt . He sat bed back resting headboard , lit cigarette , smiled slightly wry amusement , stared whimsical sympathy vivid , pop-eyed horror implanted permanently Major Danby ’ face day mission Avignon , General Dreedle ordered taken outside shot . The startled wrinkles would always remain , like deep black scars , Yossarian felt sorry gentle , moral , middle-aged idealist , felt sorry many people whose shortcomings large whose troubles light . With deliberate amiability said , “ Danby , work along people like Cathcart Korn ? Doesn ’ turn stomach ? ” Major Danby seemed surprised Yossarian ’ question . “ I help country , ” replied , though answer obvious . “ Colonel Cathcart Colonel Korn superiors , obeying orders contribution I make war effort . I work along ’ duty . And also , ” added much lower voice , dropping eyes , “ I aggressive person. ” “ Your country ’ need help , ” Yossarian reasoned antagonism . “ So ’ helping them. ” “ I try think , ” Major Danby admitted frankly . “ But I try concentrate big result forget succeeding , . I try pretend significant. ” “ That ’ trouble , know , ” Yossarian mused sympathetically , folding arms . “ Between every ideal I always find Scheisskopfs , Peckems , Korns Cathcarts . And sort changes ideal. ” “ You must try think , ” Major Danby advised affirmatively . “ And must never let change values . Ideals good , people sometimes good . You must try look big picture. ” Yossarian rejected advice skeptical shake head . “ When I look , I see people cashing . I ’ see heaven saints angels . I see people cashing every decent impulse every human tragedy. ” “ But must try think , , ” Major Danby insisted . “ And must try let upset you. ” “ Oh , ’ really upset . What upset , though , think I ’ sucker . They think ’ smart , rest us dumb . And , know , Danby , thought occurs right , first time , maybe ’ right. ” “ But must try think , ” argued Major Danby . “ You must think welfare country dignity man. ” “ Yeah , ” said Yossarian . “ I mean , Yossarian . This World War One . You must never forget ’ war aggressors would let either one us live won. ” “ I know , ” Yossarian replied tersely , sudden surge scowling annoyance . “ Christ , Danby , I earned medal I got , matter reasons giving . I ’ flown seventy goddam combat missions . Don ’ talk fighting save country . I ’ fighting along save country . Now I ’ going fight little save . The country ’ danger , I am. ” “ The war ’ yet . The Germans driving toward Antwerp. ” “ The Germans beaten months . And Japan beaten months . If I give life , ’ country . It would Cathcart Korn . So I ’ turning bombsight duration . From I ’ thinking me. ” Major Danby replied indulgently superior smile , “ But , Yossarian , suppose everyone felt way. ” “ Then I ’ certainly damned fool feel way , ’ I ? ” Yossarian sat straighter quizzical expression . “ You know , I queer feeling I ’ exact conversation someone . It ’ like chaplain ’ sensation experienced everything twice. ” “ The chaplain wants let send home , ” Major Danby remarked . “ The chaplain jump lake. ” “ Oh , dear. ” Major Danby sighed , shaking head regretful disappointment . “ He ’ afraid might influenced you. ” “ He ’ influence . You know I might ? I might stay right hospital bed vegetate . I could vegetate comfortably right let people make decisions. ” “ You must make decisions , ” Major Danby disagreed . “ A person ’ live like vegetable. ” “ Why ? ” A distant warm look entered Major Danby ’ eyes . “ It must nice live like vegetable , ” conceded wistfully . “ It ’ lousy , ” answered Yossarian . “ No , must pleasant free doubt pressure , ” insisted Major Danby . “ I think I ’ like live like vegetable make important decisions. ” “ What kind vegetable , Danby ? ” “ A cucumber carrot. ” “ What kind cucumber ? A good one bad one ? ” “ Oh , good one , course. ” “ They ’ cut prime slice salad. ” Major Danby ’ face fell . “ A poor one , then. ” “ They ’ let rot use fertilizer help good ones grow. ” “ I guess I ’ want live like vegetable , , ” said Major Danby smile sad resignation . “ Danby , must I really let send home ? ” Yossarian inquired seriously . Major Danby shrugged . “ It ’ way save yourself. ” “ It ’ way lose , Danby . You ought know that. ” “ You could lots things want. ” “ I ’ want lots things I want , ” Yossarian replied , beat fist mattress outburst rage frustration . “ Goddammit , Danby ! I ’ got friends killed war . I ’ make deal . Getting stabbed bitch best thing ever happened me. ” “ Would rather go jail ? ” “ Would let send home ? ” “ Of course I would ! ” Major Danby declared conviction . “ Certainly I would , ” added moments later , less positive manner . “ Yes , I suppose I would let send home I place , ” decided uncomfortably , lapsing troubled contemplation . Then threw face sideways disgustedly gesture violent distress blurted , “ Oh , yes , course I ’ let send home ! But I ’ terrible coward I ’ really place. ” “ But suppose ’ coward ? ” Yossarian demanded , studying closely . “ Suppose courage defy somebody ? ” “ Then I ’ let send home , ” Major Danby vowed emphatically vigorous joy enthusiasm . “ But I certainly ’ let court-martial me. ” “ Would fly missions ? ” “ No , course . That would total capitulation . And I might killed. ” “ Then ’ run away ? ” Major Danby started retort proud spirit came abrupt stop , half-opened jaw swinging closed dumbly . He pursed lips tired pout . “ I guess ’ hope , , would ? ” His forehead protuberant white eyeballs soon glistening nervously . He crossed limp wrists lap hardly seemed breathing sat gaze drooping toward floor acquiescent defeat . Dark , steep shadows slanted window . Yossarian watched solemnly , neither two men stirred rattling noise speeding vehicle skidding stop outside sound racing footsteps pounding toward building haste . “ Yes , ’ hope , ” Yossarian remembered sluggish flow inspiration . “ Milo might help . He ’ bigger Colonel Cathcart , owes favors. ” Major Danby shook head answered tonelessly . “ Milo Colonel Cathcart pals . He made Colonel Cathcart vice-president promised important job war. ” “ Then ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen help us , ” Yossarian exclaimed . “ He hates , infuriate him. ” Major Danby shook head bleakly . “ Milo ex-P.F.C . Wintergreen merged last week . They ’ partners M amp ; M Enterprises. ” “ Then hope us , ? ” “ No hope. ” “ No hope , ? ” “ No , hope , ” Major Danby conceded . He looked half-formed notion . “ Wouldn ’ nice could disappear us way disappeared others relieve us crushing burdens ? ” Yossarian said .

And review Studs Terkel Chicago daily newspaper recommended highly . So much attention work publication large part result industrious zeal appreciation literary agent , Candida Donadio , editor , Robert Gottlieb , I embrace opportunity afforded dedicate new edition , colleagues allies talents immeasurable value . The work reviewed Times publication . However , reviewed Herald Tribune Maurice Dolbier , Mr. Dolbier said : “ A wild , moving , shocking , hilarious , raging , exhilarating , giant roller-coaster book. ” That reviewer Herald Tribune came review war novel someone unknown almost entirely product coincidence . S. J. Perelman , much better known subject interview Mr. Dolbier , publishing book time . His publisher Simon amp ; Schuster , mine , editor charge work also , Bob Gottlieb . In answer question put Dolbier reading , Mr. Perelman replied much engrossed novel pressed upon editor , novel called Catch-22 . Returning office , Mr. Dolbier later confessed , found book already pile others decided would time study prospects write . Had Gottlieb , would Perelman , Perelman , would review Dolbier . And Dolbier , might Times . Two weeks afterward , probably Mr. Dolbier , book described approbation daily Times reviewer Orville Prescott , predicted would forgotten could take called : “ A dazzling performance outrage nearly many readers delights. ” The rest , one might say history , history easily misconstrued . The novel prizes bestseller list . And , Mr. Prescott foresaw , every good report , seemed appear one negative . Looking back novel twenty-five years , John Aldridge , mind perceptive persistent commentator American literature decades , lauded Robert Brustein superbly intelligent review The New Republic , contained “ essential arguments much later criticism done little improve ” , Mr. Aldridge recognised many early audience Catch-22 “ liked book reasons caused others hate ” . The disparagements frequently venomous .

But late summer 1962 , Raymond Walters , bestseller page Sunday Times , carried regularly column “ In Out Books ” , reported underground book New Yorkers seemed talking Catch-22 . ( The novel probably heavily advertised year , still underground . ) Not much later , Newsweek carried story effect space page wide . And late summer , I invited first television interview .

And confided ’ pasting stickers secretly walls corridors executive rest rooms NBC building . Then came September paperback edition , finally , expansion popular appeal seemed take publishers , Dell , surprise , despite elaborate promotion distribution strategies . It seemed people could fully bring believe sales figures would never catch . Paperback publishers print hundreds thousands . For , initial release 300,000 copies , went back press five times September end year , twice October December , end 1963 , eleven printings . In England , auspices enterprising young editor , Tom Maschler , way start . Bestseller lists new rudimentary , Catch-22 quickly head . For history Catch-22 begins back 1953 , I started writing . In 1953 , I employed copywriter small advertising agency New York , two years instructor English composition Pennsylvania State University , college . Early , anxious need approving opinion , I sent opening chapter literary agents I managed obtain publishing short stories magazines , Esquire The Atlantic . The agents impressed , young assistant , Ms. Candida Donadio , , secured permission submit chapter publications regularly published excerpts “ novels progress ” . In 1955 chapter appeared paperback quarterly , New World Writing ( anthology also contained , pseudonym , extract another novel progress-Jack Kerouac ’ On Road ) . There came complimentary letters interest editors established book publishers , I encouraged continue work I saw realistically going take good many years longer I first guessed . In 1957 , I 270 pages typescript , I employed Time magazine , writing advertising-sales presentations day furtively putting thoughts paper work novel home evening . And Candida Donadio establishing pre-eminent agent right , list American authors clients impressive . We agreed made sense submit partial manuscript publishers , mainly obtain practical idea potential publication novel thought much .

While Gottlieb busied pages , I , four-week summer vacation bountiful Time magazine , began rewriting . Gottlieb I met lunch , mainly gauge temperament ascertain amenable I would author work . After I listened allude tact certain broad suggestions thought eventually might compelled make , I handed new pages boastful response I already taken care nearly . He surprised concern I might take exception working someone young-he twenty-six , I think , I thirty-four . I greatly surprised learn later closest colleague Simon amp ; Schuster , Nina Bourne , intimidated first air suspicion I projected I know I even possessed . I suspicious since , I doubt much Gottlieb , went become head Alfred A. Knopf editor The New Yorker magazine , ever intimidated anybody . And I still remember agreeably ask outline seek even hint one-third novel ’ seen going go . The contract I received called advance fifteen hundred dollars , half signing , I need , remainder completion acceptance . Probably , I first novelist , first published ; authors completed manuscripts came three years I needed finish mine . Probably , I Candida ’ earliest client . Both delighted I eventual success Catch-22 , three us reveling recollections experience ever since . On February 28 , 1962 , journalist Richard Starnes published column unrestrained praise newspaper , The New York World-Telegram , opened words : “ Yossarian , I think , live long time. ” His tribute unexpected , Mr. Starnes newspaperman hard-boiled mode whose customary beat local politics , World-Telegram widely regarded generally conservative . To day I grateful Mr. Starnes unqualified unsolicited approval bless accuracy prediction . Yossarian indeed lived long time . Mr. Starnes passed . Many people mentioned first advertisement died , rest us way . But Yossarian alive novel ends .
